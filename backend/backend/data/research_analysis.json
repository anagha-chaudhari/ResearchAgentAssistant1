Crucially, this unified framework will incorporate a novel real-time guided wave analysis module, utilizing complex-valued wavenumber domain analysis and eigenvector shape analysis on simulated and measured wave data, to non-destructively evaluate bonding status and detect tensile stress relaxation mechanisms, thereby informing design margin policies and enabling early fault detection for active TPS configurations.

TU-CEDT will integrate advanced uncertainty quantification techniques, such as Bayesian inference and stochastic collocation on polynomial chaos expansions, directly within a coupled thermomechanical and electromagnetic finite element framework. This will enable a fundamental understanding of feasible wave mode selection for TPS bonding status evaluation by analyzing the probabilistic variations in material properties and reentry conditions. The methodology will leverage pore-scale simulations and advanced surrogate modeling, such as Deep Gaussian Process Regression informed by augmented snapshot matrices, to efficiently analyze uncertain TPS under thermomechanical coupling, going beyond scalar random variables. The digital twin will be augmented with both experimental and high-fidelity simulation data for a diverse range of TPS materials and reentry scenarios, facilitating robust reliability assessment and informing design margin policies. Experimental validation will be a core component, utilizing a high-temperature heating and arc wind tunnel to generate comprehensive datasets for model calibration and verification, specifically addressing the gap in validation with real-world data and exploring the impact of tensile stress relaxation mechanisms. Furthermore, the TU-CEDT will explore the optimization of various conformal CP antenna types beyond spiral antennas and investigate asymmetric designs for different curvatures and frequency bands, providing a holistic approach to designing resilient and high-performance conformal TPS antenna systems."

We will extend existing affine-based interval finite element methods (AIFEM) and perturbed-based interval finite element methods (PIFEM) to explicitly capture uncertainties in thermomechanical coupling during TPS assembly, explicitly quantifying dispersion and informing design margin policies. This will be achieved by developing a high-fidelity digital twin incorporating not only thermal and mechanical properties but also detailed assembly variations (clearance, step-off) derived from a comprehensive assembly pose dataset and advanced metrology techniques like tomographic imaging. To bridge the gap between simulation and practical implementation, we will employ a multi-modal sensor network (e.g., infrared thermography, eddy current testing, ultrasonic phased arrays) on fabricated TPS assemblies to generate real-time, high-resolution data. This data will then be used to train physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) that can predict both the thermal dispersion under varying operational conditions and the impact on antenna radiation performance (gain, AR, main lobe splitting) with unprecedented accuracy and speed, overcoming the limitations of traditional equivalent analytical equations and decoupling methods, and providing a pathway for evaluating TPS assembly quality in near real-time. We will establish quantitative baselines by comparing our predictions against both simulated data from advanced CFD solvers and rigorous experimental validation on complex, real-world TPS configurations, focusing on broadband applications and exploring the trade-offs between radiation efficiency and performance degradation."

The PIHDT integrates advanced computational techniques to address the identified research gaps, moving beyond isolated simulations and experiments. It begins with **generative adversarial physics-informed neural networks (GAN-PINNs)** trained on existing simulation data (flow-thermal, material response, dispersion loci) and limited experimental measurements (heating, antenna performance) to create high-fidelity, data-driven surrogate models of TPS behavior under extreme reentry conditions, explicitly accounting for dispersion effects and tensile stress relaxation. These surrogate models inform a **multi-objective digital twin** capable of real-time performance prediction and optimization, considering not only antenna parameters (AR, radiation pattern) but also novel objectives like thermal efficiency and material cost. The digital twin is further enhanced by a **probabilistic assembly deviation model** that couples with the PIHDT's predictive capabilities to quantify the impact of manufacturing imperfections on antenna performance and TPS integrity, enabling robust design margin policies. Finally, the PIHDT framework facilitates **active learning-driven experimental validation**, strategically guiding the fabrication and testing of optimized antenna-TPS configurations and novel active TPS designs, thus generating targeted datasets to further refine the surrogate models and enhance the accuracy and efficiency of TPS assembly quality assessment. This holistic approach aims to provide a comprehensive and predictive methodology for designing high-performance conformal antennas in challenging high-temperature environments."

Unlike previous approaches that relied heavily on direct material transfer and established manufacturing, this methodology will employ high-fidelity computational fluid dynamics (CFD) and finite element analysis (FEA) coupled with a digital twin framework. This framework will be populated with data generated from experimental characterization of Apollo Avcoat and Space Shuttle tile materials under a wide range of simulated re-entry conditions, including non-uniform heating and aerodynamic loads. Furthermore, we will introduce a novel machine learning component to predict material degradation and structural integrity by analyzing the output from these high-fidelity simulations, aiming to bridge the gap left by the absence of existing datasets and proactively identify potential failure modes. The resulting models will inform generative design algorithms, enabling the exploration of entirely new TPS architectures and material combinations that move beyond direct replication of historical solutions, thereby addressing the implicit gap of not having explicit future-oriented design strategies."

The ML component would learn the complex relationships between material properties, structural configurations, and thermal performance, enabling rapid design exploration and identification of optimal material combinations and assembly techniques. Furthermore, a key innovation would be the development of physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) to ensure that learned relationships adhere to fundamental thermodynamic and thermochemical principles, thereby increasing the interpretability and reliability of the model for critical spaceflight applications. This framework would facilitate the prediction of TPS performance under novel mission environments not directly experienced by Apollo or Shuttle, and could be trained to predict the degradation of TPS over multiple missions, thereby addressing the implicit need for more sustainable and reusable TPS solutions without explicitly stated gaps."

This approach directly addresses the research gaps concerning the non-uniformity of pore distribution and the computational expense of mesoscale simulations by employing a multi-scale fractal representation of the pore structure, derived from SEM and potentially photogrammetric data, to inform a computationally efficient effective diffusion model. This fractal model will be integrated into a progressive complexity framework, allowing for adaptive refinement of pyrolysis and gasification sub-models based on iterative data fitting from experimental campaigns. To overcome the limited access to specialized ablative materials for laboratory experiments, we will focus on developing and characterizing a standardized, manufacturable carbon-fiber reinforced composite, akin to HARLEM, utilizing readily available precursors and a simplified impregnation process. The model will be validated through a joint experimental study involving arcjet testing, thermography, and photogrammetry for surface temperature and recession rate measurements, with collected data feeding into a gradient-informed Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) framework to simultaneously identify key thermophysical parameters and quantify uncertainties, providing a more robust and physically grounded prediction of ablation rates compared to traditional methods."

Leveraging the extracted gaps, our methodology will integrate deep generative models with established physical principles to address the complex interplay between TPS properties and antenna performance under hypersonic flight conditions.  Specifically, the PI-GAN will be trained on a multi-modal dataset combining existing simulation results, high-temperature heating experiment data, and assembly pose datasets, augmented by pore-scale numerical simulations of TPS microstructures.  The \"physics-informed\" aspect will ensure the generator respects fundamental electromagnetic wave propagation laws and thermomechanical coupling equations, implicitly addressing performance degradation, AR deterioration, main lobe splitting, and wave mode selection gaps.  The adversarial training will push the generator to produce novel TPS designs, including advanced triply periodic minimal surfaces with tunable geometric parameters and material properties, and corresponding antenna configurations that minimize performance loss, thereby addressing the limited solutions for antenna design under conformal TPS and the need for compact, high-performance designs.  Crucially, the trained PI-GAN will be capable of generating surrogate models for efficient and accurate real-time measurement of assembly quality by learning the correlation between assembly deviations and predicted antenna performance, thus bridging the gap in assembly quality assessment.  Furthermore, the model will be designed to predict the impact of simulated debonding conditions on antenna performance, offering a new avenue for understanding wave mode responses and enabling proactive repair strategies.  This PI-GAN framework will also inherently incorporate uncertainty quantification by learning the stochastic nature of thermal response from the high-temperature heating data and numerical simulations, providing a robust method for thermomechanical coupled uncertainty analysis.  Finally, by generating optimized TPS material compositions or structural modifications that inherently mitigate antenna degradation without altering external profiles, this approach directly tackles the need for repair solutions without structural modification."

AMSST leverages a dual-architecture: an adaptive State Space Model (SSM) backbone to efficiently handle long-range dependencies and variable-length sequences, addressing limitations in copying and retrieving information across substantial contexts, and a flexible Transformer-decoder for local refinement and multi-modal fusion. The SSM component will incorporate novel techniques for dynamic latent state resizing and cross-frequency learning, enabling it to accommodate an arbitrary number of variates and varying distributional properties in time series data, while also mitigating the quadratic scaling issues of pure Transformers on long protein sequences. For image synthesis, AMSST will integrate a rectified flow module with improved noise sampling strategies, designed for efficient high-resolution generation on consumer hardware by biasing sampling towards perceptually relevant scales. The Transformer decoder will be enhanced with attention mechanisms that explicitly learn variate-centric representations and integrate multi-modal information by treating image patches and text tokens distinctly, thus overcoming the meaningless attention map problem and better handling multimodal information for text-to-image synthesis. This methodology aims to achieve state-of-the-art performance across diverse tasks by synergistically combining the strengths of SSMs and Transformers, while offering significant improvements in computational efficiency and scalability."

We hypothesize that by training a unified model that leverages CNNs for efficient local feature extraction and typography handling in text-to-image tasks, and SSMs (specifically a refined Mamba variant) for efficient, long-range context handling in language and time series, we can overcome the performance gaps and computational bottlenecks of current Transformer-based approaches. For text-to-image generation, we will adapt Linear Diffusion Transformers with REPA regularization, biasing their noise sampling towards perceptually relevant scales inspired by rectified flow, and employ decoupled image and text modality embeddings to facilitate better cross-modal understanding. For time series, we will extend the Inverted Transformer architecture by applying CNNs to variate-centric tokens and incorporating a temporal self-attention mechanism for historical fusion, enabling universal forecasting models capable of handling arbitrary variate counts and cross-frequency learning. Crucially, this UMRLG framework will be trained using a novel, multi-objective pretraining strategy that jointly optimizes for representation quality (inspired by self-supervised learning) and generative fidelity, and further enhanced by a deep compression autoencoder to enable efficient high-resolution synthesis. This methodology aims to bridge the gap between the representational power of diffusion models and the efficiency of SSMs and CNNs, leading to more performant, scalable, and computationally efficient models across a diverse range of AI tasks, with a particular focus on text-to-image generation with improved text comprehension and time series forecasting with robust cross-variate and cross-frequency learning."

HV-SST will leverage the linear scalability of State Space Models (SSMs) at its core to handle extremely long sequences, directly tackling the quadratic scaling limitations of traditional Transformers and the scalability issues of linear attention to high resolutions. Within this SSM backbone, we introduce a hierarchical attention mechanism that first applies variate-centric feed-forward networks to individual variate tokens, fostering better variate-specific representation learning, before employing a novel structured attention variant for cross-variate and temporal fusion. This structured attention will be informed by recent advancements in GSSMs and rectified flow concepts, aiming to improve copying and retrieval capabilities beyond current SSMs. Furthermore, we will investigate a multi-stage pretraining strategy that disentangles representation learning tasks from downstream forecasting or generation objectives, mirroring the success of masked language modeling but adapted for multi-variate sequences and potentially incorporating elements of rectified flow noise sampling for improved generative fidelity. Our evaluation will span challenging time series forecasting benchmarks with large lookback windows, and a modified text-to-image generation task focusing on fine-grained textual control and typological accuracy, comparing our approach against state-of-the-art Transformers, Mamba variants, and existing diffusion models, while also exploring the potential of CNN-inspired local processing modules within the hierarchical structure for tasks where local feature extraction is paramount, such as protein sequence pretraining."

VA-SST will employ an SSM backbone for efficient processing of long sequences, overcoming the quadratic scaling limitations of Transformers and improving efficiency and generalization on copying tasks, particularly on large-scale time-series and protein sequence data. To counter the fixed-size latent state limitations of GSSMs and the fused embedding issue in Transformers, VA-SST will introduce a \"variate-centric\" attention mechanism where each variate (e.g., amino acid, time step) has its own learned latent representation, allowing for richer, disentangled embeddings. This mechanism will leverage SSM duality principles to enable effective bidirectional information flow between these variate representations. Furthermore, VA-SST will incorporate a novel bridging module that translates these learned variate-centric representations into a latent space suitable for diffusion models, enabling high-quality, efficient, and potentially smaller text-to-image synthesis on consumer hardware by addressing representation learning bottlenecks and accelerating convergence. By disentangling architectural choices from pretraining tasks, we will investigate the impact of this hybrid architecture on representation learning quality and its correlation with downstream tasks, aiming to bridge the performance gap between Transformer and SSM-based LLMs and establish a more robust understanding of their theoretical underpinnings."

The quantification of order-chaos boundaries will be achieved by linking these period spacings to a prolateness parameter, going beyond traditional Lyapunov exponent analysis to map resonance structures with unprecedented fidelity, and this will be validated against high-resolution observational data from CRIRES+/VLT, offering a more complete picture of rotational dynamics in celestial bodies."

The BKMP will leverage smart contracts to record and verify medicinal plant provenance and fair pricing information, directly addressing the information gap for farmers and creating a transparent, NMPB-recognized supply chain. This platform will also host a user-friendly, gamified educational module on dental patenting, making the process more comprehensible and time-bound for entrepreneurs and students. Concurrently, the AR Identification Tool will utilize deep learning for accurate medicinal plant identification, mitigating misidentification and adulteration concerns, and will be integrated with the BKMP to display verified information and trusted seller ratings, fostering trust among rural consumers with digital platforms. Our methodology will involve collecting data through surveys, interviews with farmers, dentists, and patent officials, and analyzing historical patent data alongside market trends, with qualitative analysis of user feedback to iteratively refine the BKMP and AR tool."

This approach directly addresses the identified gaps by moving beyond mere prediction to understand the *drivers* of temporal variations in prices and arrivals across different agricultural commodities (extending beyond cotton and barley). By incorporating dynamic external factors such as weather patterns, policy changes, global economic indicators, and even sentiment analysis from news and social media, our ST-GNNs can model complex, non-linear interactions and evolving market dynamics. Feature engineering and optimization techniques, like the Whale Optimization Algorithm, will be employed for selecting relevant external factors and network architectures. Furthermore, the methodology will explicitly compare the effectiveness of traditional dissemination approaches with information derived from DMTSC-CI, focusing on delivering actionable quality information and price projections to farmers, thereby fulfilling unmet expectations. The \"broader applications\" gap will be addressed by designing a modular framework adaptable to various commodities and market structures, leveraging the rich datasets from MCX, SEBI, and Indian agricultural markets."

ARS-TLL combines the strengths of existing approaches by establishing a simulated, yet functionally representative, healthcare environment where novel LLM applications can be iteratively developed, tested, and refined under controlled regulatory oversight, bridging the gap between theoretical regulatory analysis and practical implementation science. We will leverage regulatory sandbox principles (drawing from existing financial and broader AI regulations) to allow for controlled experimentation with LLMs for specific use cases (e.g., diagnostic support, treatment planning). Simultaneously, this sandbox will operate as a \"living lab\" incorporating implementation science frameworks (like TAM and NASSS) and real-world feedback mechanisms, including simulated patient data compliance checks (GDPR/HIPAA analogues), workforce training modules, and iterative ethical reviews by a multidisciplinary team of clinicians, ethicists, legal experts, and AI developers. The data generated within ARS-TLL will inform the development of a dynamic, \"living\" regulatory framework specifically for LLMs in healthcare, explicitly addressing their unique capabilities and risks, and will be informed by a continuous feedback loop from simulated clinical scenarios and educational interventions designed to address current medical training deficits. This approach directly tackles research gaps in secure data management, LLM-specific regulation, reliability/safety, transparency, ethical and medico-legal implications, workforce utilization, and structured adoption programs by providing a practical, iterative platform for both technological advancement and regulatory maturation."

Crucially, AMPR will leverage and expand upon existing experimental datasets, including 3D MRV measurements and hydrodynamic characteristics, by developing intelligent data assimilation techniques. This will enable a continuous calibration and validation loop, where discrepancies between lower-fidelity simulations and sparse experimental data drive adaptive refinement of simulation resolution and physics models, specifically targeting turbulence anisotropy, multi-phase flow interactions, and fuel-cladding chemical kinetics. This dynamic approach will allow for robust justification of fuel assembly designs, refinement of cell-by-cell thermohydraulic calculations, and comprehensive validation of CFD programs like LOGOS against complex industrial geometries, while providing new insights into core meltdown phenomena through targeted high-fidelity investigations informed by experimental validation."

        "abstract": "Accurate characterization of thermal-hydraulic and thermochemical phenomena within nuclear reactor fuel assemblies is paramount for ensuring safe and efficient operation, particularly under off-normal conditions. This review synthesizes recent research focused on understanding complex processes occurring within fuel bundles, spanning normal operation, accident scenarios, and severe accident progression. Investigations into radiative heat transfer within pressurized heavy water reactor fuel bundles during loss of coolant accidents highlight the development of radial temperature gradients and the effectiveness of analytical methods like the radiosity network approach. Concurrently, advancements in computational fluid dynamics are explored, with studies evaluating the efficacy of methods such as Partially Averaged Navier-Stokes (PANS) for capturing flow physics in geometries with spacer grids, bridging the gap between Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) and Direct Numerical Simulation (DNS). Experimental techniques, including airflow simulations of coolant flow and the sophisticated Magnetic Resonance Velocimetry (MRV), are providing crucial volumetric velocity and Reynolds stress tensor data, essential for computational model validation. Furthermore, research into severe accident scenarios, such as core meltdowns, employs advanced numerical techniques like the Moving Particle Semi-Implicit (MPS) method to simulate fuel rod melting, molten material migration, and associated chemical reactions. This review critically examines these diverse approaches, identifying persistent challenges and opportunities for future research in enhancing the predictive capabilities of thermal-hydraulic and thermochemical models for nuclear reactor safety.",
        "introduction": "The safe and economical operation of nuclear reactors hinges on a profound understanding of the intricate thermal-hydraulic and thermochemical phenomena that govern the behavior of fuel assemblies. Within these assemblies, the precise transport of heat from fuel rods to the coolant, coupled with the hydrodynamics of the coolant flow, dictates core performance and safety margins. Under normal operating conditions, these factors influence thermal efficiency and power output. However, during transient events, such as loss of coolant accidents (LOCAs), or in the extreme scenarios of severe accidents leading to core meltdown, the thermal environment can dramatically change. Understanding fuel rod behavior, heat transfer mechanisms, and coolant flow dynamics under these diverse conditions is critical for robust reactor design, accident mitigation strategies, and the development of advanced safety systems. This review critically examines recent advancements in the investigation of these phenomena, highlighting the interplay between experimental characterization and computational modeling.",
        "literature_review": "Investigations into thermal processes within nuclear fuel bundles have focused on both normal and accident conditions. For instance, the analysis of radiative heat transfer in a Pressurized Heavy Water Reactor (PHWR) 37-pin fuel bundle during a heat-up scenario, specifically under a LOCA with emergency core cooling system (ECCS) failure, has been undertaken using a combination of experimental, numerical (ANSYS® Fluent), and analytical (radiosity network method) techniques. These studies have revealed significant radial temperature gradients within the fuel bundle simulator, while circumferential gradients were found to be negligible.\n\nConcurrently, significant efforts have been dedicated to improving the fidelity of computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations for flow within fuel bundles. The Partially Averaged Navier-Stokes (PANS) method, which offers a flexible framework to bridge Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) and Large Eddy Simulation (LES) by adjusting filter cutoffs, has been evaluated for its capability to accurately capture key flow physics in fuel bundles equipped with spacer grids. Such approaches aim to provide a more detailed understanding of turbulent flow structures and anisotropic behavior, which are crucial for predicting pressure drop and heat transfer.\n\nExperimental characterization of coolant flow remains a cornerstone for validating computational models. Studies employing aerodynamic models with airflow to simulate water coolant flow have utilized pneumometric and contrast agent injection methods to visualize axial and cross-flow structures within fuel rod bundles. Similarly, the RITM reactor fuel assembly has been studied using scale models and a pneumometric method to generate cartograms of axial and tangential velocities, providing valuable data for CFD program validation. More advanced experimental techniques, such as Magnetic Resonance Velocimetry (MRV), have been developed to provide volumetric measurements of mean velocity vectors and the Reynolds stress tensor in complex geometries, such as a 5x5 fuel assembly model with mixing grids, offering high accuracy for CFD validation in Pressurized Water Reactor (PWR) applications.\n\nFor severe accident scenarios, such as core meltdowns, numerical methods like the Moving Particle Semi-Implicit (MPS) method have been employed to simulate fuel rod melting, molten material migration, and associated thermochemical interactions. These three-dimensional simulations incorporate models for heat transfer, eutectic reactions, and surface tension, and have been validated against analytical solutions and experimental data, demonstrating accurate prediction of temperature, phase transitions, and the influence of factors like atomic diffusion and radiation heat transfer on melting behavior.",
        "research_gaps": "Despite significant progress in understanding the complex phenomena within nuclear fuel assemblies, several critical research gaps persist. Firstly, while various computational approaches, from PANS to MPS, are being developed and refined, there remains a consistent need for comprehensive, high-fidelity experimental data across a range of conditions to rigorously validate these models. Specifically, detailed flow field measurements, including turbulence statistics and anisotropic behavior in geometries with complex features like spacer grids, are crucial. The effectiveness of advanced velocimetry techniques, such as MRV, in capturing these intricate flow structures in industrial-relevant geometries warrants further exploration and comparative studies.\n\nSecondly, the accurate modeling of radiative heat transfer, particularly during accident scenarios where high temperatures and diverse surface properties are prevalent, requires continued attention. While analytical methods exist, their application to complex, multi-component fuel bundles and the integration with CFD codes need further development and validation.\n\nThirdly, for severe accident simulations, a deeper understanding of the interplay between fuel rod melting, molten material migration, and associated thermochemical reactions is required. This includes quantifying the precise influence of factors such as atomic diffusion, radiation heat transfer, initial temperature distributions, and molten pool depth on phenomena like cladding dissolution and UO2 migration dynamics. Bridging the gap between idealized simulations and real-world accident progression demands more sophisticated coupling of thermal-hydraulic and materials science models.\n\nFinally, the practical application of these advanced models for justifying fuel assembly designs and refining thermohydraulic calculations across different reactor types (e.g., PHWR, PWR, SMRs) necessitates standardized validation procedures and accessible, high-quality experimental databases. The sensitivity of simulation results to various modeling parameters and geometric complexities also requires systematic investigation.",
        "conclusion": "The reviewed literature underscores a strong, ongoing commitment to advancing the understanding of thermal-hydraulic and thermochemical processes within nuclear fuel assemblies. Significant strides have been made in both experimental measurement techniques and computational modeling capabilities, enabling researchers to probe increasingly complex phenomena, from normal operational heat transfer to the intricate dynamics of severe accident progression. Advanced experimental methods are providing unprecedented detail on flow fields and material behavior, while sophisticated numerical techniques are offering pathways to simulate previously intractable scenarios. However, several critical areas necessitate future research. Continued development and validation of coupled multi-physics models are essential, particularly for severe accident scenarios where the interaction of melting, fluid dynamics, and chemical reactions dictates outcomes. Future work should focus on enhancing the predictive accuracy of these models through rigorous validation against comprehensive experimental datasets, especially for geometries with complex internal structures and under a wide range of thermal-hydraulic conditions. The exploration of advanced turbulence modeling strategies and the accurate incorporation of radiative heat transfer remain crucial for improving the fidelity of simulations. Furthermore, the standardization of validation methodologies and the creation of accessible, high-quality benchmark data will be instrumental in facilitating the reliable application of these advanced simulation tools for reactor design, safety analysis, and operational optimization."

While 21 methods, 8 datasets, and 5 baselines were collected, the absence of identified gaps suggests a superficial review or a lack of deep engagement with the literature. The sample gaps are also missing, making it difficult to assess the depth of the research.",

However, without clearly defined research gaps, it's hard to definitively say if the collected findings are coherently organized to address specific problems. The proposed methodology's coherence hinges on its ability to bridge identified gaps, which are currently absent.",

This approach leverages the strengths of both computational and experimental methods and can lead to more accurate and efficient simulations.

This deficiency undermines the comprehensiveness and coherence of the analysis, as the collected methods and datasets are not explicitly tied to solving specific problems. The proposed methodology itself is strong and could be highly impactful if grounded in a thorough literature review that highlights clear areas for improvement."

We will leverage a cell-by-cell advanced thermohydraulic calculation method, building upon existing approaches by incorporating higher-fidelity modeling of inter-cell flow and heat transfer coupling, potentially utilizing a hybrid URANS/LES approach within different regions of the bundle to capture both bulk flow and localized turbulent structures with improved accuracy. This will be coupled with a refined molten material migration model that integrates heat transfer, eutectic reactions, and surface tension effects, inspired by existing methodologies but enhanced with a novel approach for handling phase change and complex interfacial phenomena under severe accident conditions. To address the critical lack of experimental data for CFD validation in SMR bundles, we will develop and employ a newly designed, high-fidelity experimental facility that incorporates advanced non-intrusive measurement techniques like enhanced MRV and potentially particle image velocimetry (PIV) with specialized tracers capable of operating in high-temperature/radiation simulated environments, allowing for detailed volumetric measurements of flow fields and temperature profiles. This facility will be designed to generate data for both nominal operating conditions and simulated severe accident scenarios, providing a rich dataset to validate and refine the proposed CFD models, including those for LOGOS and other advanced codes, and to directly inform fuel assembly design justification through detailed flow and thermal characteristic analysis.",

        "abstract": "Accurate characterization of thermal-hydraulic phenomena within nuclear fuel assemblies is paramount for ensuring reactor safety and optimizing operational efficiency. This review synthesizes recent advancements in experimental and computational approaches employed to investigate complex flow and heat transfer behaviors within these geometries. Studies encompassing steady-state and accident scenarios, such as Loss of Coolant Accidents (LOCA), highlight the critical role of radiative heat transfer, particularly in pressurized heavy water reactor (PHWR) fuel bundles, where significant radial temperature gradients are observed. Furthermore, investigations into coolant flow dynamics, employing methods ranging from detailed aerodynamic modeling based on hydrodynamic similarity to advanced Magnetic Resonance Velocimetry (MRV), provide essential data for validating computational fluid dynamics (CFD) models. The application of advanced turbulence modeling techniques, such as the Partially Averaged Navier-Stokes (PANS) method, demonstrates promise in bridging the gap between Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) and Direct Numerical Simulation (DNS) for capturing intricate flow physics around spacer grids. These diverse research efforts underscore a persistent need for high-fidelity experimental datasets and refined computational tools to support the design, safety analysis, and performance optimization of modern nuclear reactor cores, particularly in emerging designs like small modular reactors (SMRs). The integration of these findings is crucial for advancing the understanding of fuel rod behavior under various operational conditions, including extreme accident scenarios involving fuel melting and molten material migration.",
        "introduction": "The design and safe operation of nuclear reactors are intrinsically linked to a profound understanding of the thermal-hydraulic conditions within the fuel assemblies. These core components are responsible for efficient heat generation and transfer, making the precise characterization of fluid flow and heat transport critical. Deviations from nominal conditions, whether due to operational transients or severe accident scenarios like a Loss of Coolant Accident (LOCA), can lead to significant thermal stresses and potentially compromise fuel integrity. Consequently, robust predictive capabilities are required to simulate and analyze these phenomena. This necessitates the development and validation of sophisticated experimental techniques and computational methodologies that can accurately represent the complex, multi-physics interactions occurring within densely packed fuel rod bundles. The pursuit of enhanced safety margins, improved fuel utilization, and the development of next-generation reactor concepts, such as Small Modular Reactors (SMRs), further amplifies the demand for detailed and reliable data on fuel assembly behavior under a wide spectrum of operating conditions and potential off-normal events.",
        "methodology": null,
        "literature_review": "Research into the thermal-hydraulic behavior of nuclear fuel assemblies has seen significant contributions from both experimental and computational investigations. Studies have focused on characterizing heat transfer mechanisms, particularly radiative heat transfer, within fuel bundles during accident scenarios. For instance, analysis of a 37-pin PHWR fuel bundle under simulated LOCA conditions coupled with ECCS failure revealed significant radial temperature gradients, a finding supported by experimental, numerical, and analytical methods such as the radiosity network method.  Regarding flow dynamics, investigations have employed a range of techniques to capture intricate flow patterns. Aerodynamic modeling based on hydrodynamic similarity has been utilized to study coolant flow in fuel rod bundles for SMRs, providing insights into axial and cross-flows and generating data for CFD model validation.  Advanced velocimetry techniques, such as Magnetic Resonance Velocimetry (MRV), have been developed to provide volumetric measurements of mean velocity vectors and Reynolds stress tensors in fuel assembly models with mixing grids, achieving high accuracy and offering valuable validation data for CFD.  Furthermore, experimental studies on specific reactor designs, such as the RITM reactor fuel assembly, have utilized pneumometric methods and visualization techniques to map axial and tangential velocities, contributing to design substantiation and CFD validation.  In the realm of computational fluid dynamics, advanced turbulence modeling approaches are being explored. The Partially Averaged Navier-Stokes (PANS) method, which effectively bridges RANS and LES, has shown promise in simulating flow through fuel bundles with spacer grids, demonstrating its capability to capture key flow physics when configured appropriately.  Beyond standard operational conditions, research has also delved into severe accident phenomena. The Moving Particle Semi-Implicit (MPS) method has been employed to numerically investigate fuel rod melting and molten material migration, incorporating models for heat transfer, eutectic reactions, and surface tension to simulate complex phase transitions and material movement with validation against experimental data and analytical solutions.",
        "research_gaps": "Despite considerable progress, several critical research gaps remain in the comprehensive understanding and simulation of nuclear fuel assembly behavior. A persistent need exists for the refinement of thermohydraulic calculation methods, particularly those employing a cell-by-cell approximation for reactor cores, to enhance predictive accuracy. This is closely related to the broader requirement for improved methods for thermal-hydraulic calculations of nuclear reactor cores in general.  Furthermore, there is a recognized lack of experimental data specifically tailored for validating CFD programs in the context of SMR fuel rod bundles, hindering the reliable deployment of these advanced designs.  Beyond standard operational concerns, a significant gap lies in the comprehensive understanding of fuel rod behavior during severe accidents. This includes detailed insights into fuel melting, molten material migration, and their subsequent impact on core integrity, phenomena that are inherently complex and necessitate sophisticated simulation capabilities.  The validation of specific CFD programs, such as LOGOS, also remains an area requiring dedicated effort.  Ultimately, the justification and optimization of fuel assembly designs are fundamentally dependent on detailed flow characteristics, highlighting the need for continued generation of such data, particularly from advanced measurement techniques.",
        "conclusion": "The reviewed literature underscores the ongoing evolution of experimental and computational methodologies for characterizing thermal-hydraulic phenomena within nuclear fuel assemblies. Significant advancements have been made in obtaining detailed flow and heat transfer data, ranging from radiative heat transfer in accident scenarios to intricate coolant flow patterns in operational configurations. The development and application of advanced techniques, such as MRV for flow field measurements and PANS for turbulence modeling, demonstrate a commitment to enhancing predictive capabilities. However, persistent research gaps necessitate further investigation. Future research should prioritize the generation of comprehensive, high-fidelity experimental datasets for advanced reactor designs, particularly SMRs, to rigorously validate CFD models. Continued development and refinement of thermohydraulic calculation methods, including those that account for complex phenomena like fuel melting and molten material migration, are essential. Focused efforts on validating specific CFD codes with these benchmark datasets will be crucial. Ultimately, addressing these gaps will contribute to enhanced reactor safety, improved operational efficiency, and the successful deployment of next-generation nuclear energy systems."

            "summary": "The rapid advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) have led to the development of sophisticated large language models (LLMs) such as GPT-4 and Bard. The potential implementation of LLMs in healthcare settings has already garnered considerable attention because of their diverse applications that include facilitating clinical documentation, obtaining insurance pre-authorization, summarizing research papers, or working as a chatbot to answer questions for patients about their specific data and concerns. While offering transformative potential, LLMs warrant a very cautious approach since these models are trained differently from AI-based medical technologies that are regulated already, especially within the critical context of caring for patients. The newest version, GPT-4, that was released in March, 2023, brings the potentials of this technology to support multiple medical tasks; and risks from mishandling results it provides to varying reliability to a new level. Besides being an advanced LLM, it will be able to read texts on images and analyze the context of those images. The regulation of GPT-4 and generative AI in medicine and healthcare without damaging their exciting and transformative potential is a timely and critical challenge to ensure safety, maintain ethical standards, and protect patient privacy. We argue that regulatory oversight should assure medical professionals and patients can use LLMs without causing harm or compromising their data or privacy. This paper summarizes our practical recommendations for what we can expect from regulators to bring this vision to reality."

            "summary": "Artificial intelligence (AI), particularly generative AI, has emerged as a transformative tool in healthcare, with the potential to revolutionize clinical decision-making and improve health outcomes. Generative AI, capable of generating new data such as text and images, holds promise in enhancing patient care, revolutionizing disease diagnosis and expanding treatment options. However, the utility and impact of generative AI in healthcare remain poorly understood, with concerns around ethical and medico-legal implications, integration into healthcare service delivery and workforce utilisation. Also, there is not a clear pathway to implement and integrate generative AI in healthcare delivery. This article aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the use of generative AI in healthcare, focusing on the utility of the technology in healthcare and its translational application highlighting the need for careful planning, execution and management of expectations in adopting generative AI in clinical medicine. Key considerations include factors such as data privacy, security and the irreplaceable role of clinicians’ expertise. Frameworks like the technology acceptance model (TAM) and the Non-Adoption, Abandonment, Scale-up, Spread and Sustainability (NASSS) model are considered to promote responsible integration. These frameworks allow anticipating and proactively addressing barriers to adoption, facilitating stakeholder participation and responsibly transitioning care systems to harness generative AI’s potential. Generative AI has the potential to transform healthcare through automated systems, enhanced clinical decision-making and democratization of expertise with diagnostic support tools providing timely, personalized suggestions. Generative AI applications across billing, diagnosis, treatment and research can also make healthcare delivery more efficient, equitable and effective. However, integration of generative AI necessitates meticulous change management and risk mitigation strategies. Technological capabilities alone cannot shift complex care ecosystems overnight; rather, structured adoption programs grounded in implementation science are imperative. It is strongly argued in this article that generative AI can usher in tremendous healthcare progress, if introduced responsibly. Strategic adoption based on implementation science, incremental deployment and balanced messaging around opportunities versus limitations helps promote safe, ethical generative AI integration. Extensive real-world piloting and iteration aligned to clinical priorities should drive development. With conscientious governance centred on human wellbeing over technological novelty, generative AI can enhance accessibility, affordability and quality of care. As these models continue advancing rapidly, ongoing reassessment and transparent communication around their strengths and weaknesses remain vital to restoring trust, realizing positive potential and, most importantly, improving patient outcomes."

            "summary": "Introduction: Artificial intelligence (AI)-enhanced technology has seen unprecedented expansion in the recent past. This growth brings with it huge opportunities for the positive transformation of the economy, business, healthcare, and society. However, a critical question is whether, and to what extent, regulatory measures and mechanisms have been implemented to safeguard its design, development, and deployment. This paper offers a scoping exercise that maps the regulatory landscape of AI in healthcare (including health research) in certain African countries. Methods: This research is conducted across 12 African countries: Botswana, Cameroon, The Gambia, Ghana, Kenya, Malawi, Nigeria, Rwanda, South Africa, Tanzania, Uganda, and Zimbabwe. As limited specific AI legislation is found in these African countries, and because AI is informed by ancillary regulatory frameworks, we include data protection, digital health, consumer protection, and intellectual property in our research. A scoping review method was applied with a manual search of digital libraries with search terms customised for each repository consisting of core search terms for the various topics, including, among others, “law,” “regulation,” “artificial intelligence,” “data protection,” “intellectual property,” and “digital health”. Results and discussion: Analysis of the data demonstrated that while in the African countries under investigation there is no sui generis AI regulation, recent developments were found in areas that inform AI adoption, including in digital health, data protection, consumer protection, and intellectual property. Our findings highlight the fragmentation of the African AI regulatory landscape and illustrate the importance of continued AI regulatory development to ensure that Africa is well positioned for future AI adoption in health."

            "summary": "Artificial intelligence (AI) has the potential to revolutionize healthcare, for example via decision support systems, computer vision approaches, or AI-based prevention tools. Initial results from AI applications in healthcare show promise but are rarely translated into clinical practice successfully and ethically. This occurs despite an abundance of “Trustworthy AI” guidelines. How can we explain the translational gaps of AI in healthcare? This paper offers a fresh perspective on this problem, showing that failing translation of healthcare AI markedly arises from a lack of an operational definition of “trust” and “trustworthiness”. This leads to (a) unintentional misuse concerning what trust (worthiness) is and (b) the risk of intentional abuse by industry stakeholders engaging in ethics washing. By pointing out these issues, we aim to highlight the obstacles that hinder translation of Trustworthy medical AI to practice and prevent it from fulfilling its unmet promises."

            "summary": "The rapid advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) have led to the development of sophisticated large language models (LLMs) such as GPT-4 and Bard. The potential implementation of LLMs in healthcare settings has already garnered considerable attention because of their diverse applications that include facilitating clinical documentation, obtaining insurance pre-authorization, summarizing research papers, or working as a chatbot to answer questions for patients about their specific data and concerns. While offering transformative potential, LLMs warrant a very cautious approach since these models are trained differently from AI-based medical technologies that are regulated already, especially within the critical context of caring for patients. The newest version, GPT-4, that was released in March, 2023, brings the potentials of this technology to support multiple medical tasks; and risks from mishandling results it provides to varying reliability to a new level. Besides being an advanced LLM, it will be able to read texts on images and analyze the context of those images. The regulation of GPT-4 and generative AI in medicine and healthcare without damaging their exciting and transformative potential is a timely and critical challenge to ensure safety, maintain ethical standards, and protect patient privacy. We argue that regulatory oversight should assure medical professionals and patients can use LLMs without causing harm or compromising their data or privacy. This paper summarizes our practical recommendations for what we can expect from regulators to bring this vision to reality."

            "summary": "Artificial intelligence (AI), particularly generative AI, has emerged as a transformative tool in healthcare, with the potential to revolutionize clinical decision-making and improve health outcomes. Generative AI, capable of generating new data such as text and images, holds promise in enhancing patient care, revolutionizing disease diagnosis and expanding treatment options. However, the utility and impact of generative AI in healthcare remain poorly understood, with concerns around ethical and medico-legal implications, integration into healthcare service delivery and workforce utilisation. Also, there is not a clear pathway to implement and integrate generative AI in healthcare delivery. This article aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the use of generative AI in healthcare, focusing on the utility of the technology in healthcare and its translational application highlighting the need for careful planning, execution and management of expectations in adopting generative AI in clinical medicine. Key considerations include factors such as data privacy, security and the irreplaceable role of clinicians’ expertise. Frameworks like the technology acceptance model (TAM) and the Non-Adoption, Abandonment, Scale-up, Spread and Sustainability (NASSS) model are considered to promote responsible integration. These frameworks allow anticipating and proactively addressing barriers to adoption, facilitating stakeholder participation and responsibly transitioning care systems to harness generative AI’s potential. Generative AI has the potential to transform healthcare through automated systems, enhanced clinical decision-making and democratization of expertise with diagnostic support tools providing timely, personalized suggestions. Generative AI applications across billing, diagnosis, treatment and research can also make healthcare delivery more efficient, equitable and effective. However, integration of generative AI necessitates meticulous change management and risk mitigation strategies. Technological capabilities alone cannot shift complex care ecosystems overnight; rather, structured adoption programs grounded in implementation science are imperative. It is strongly argued in this article that generative AI can usher in tremendous healthcare progress, if introduced responsibly. Strategic adoption based on implementation science, incremental deployment and balanced messaging around opportunities versus limitations helps promote safe, ethical generative AI integration. Extensive real-world piloting and iteration aligned to clinical priorities should drive development. With conscientious governance centred on human wellbeing over technological novelty, generative AI can enhance accessibility, affordability and quality of care. As these models continue advancing rapidly, ongoing reassessment and transparent communication around their strengths and weaknesses remain vital to restoring trust, realizing positive potential and, most importantly, improving patient outcomes."

            "summary": "Introduction: Artificial intelligence (AI)-enhanced technology has seen unprecedented expansion in the recent past. This growth brings with it huge opportunities for the positive transformation of the economy, business, healthcare, and society. However, a critical question is whether, and to what extent, regulatory measures and mechanisms have been implemented to safeguard its design, development, and deployment. This paper offers a scoping exercise that maps the regulatory landscape of AI in healthcare (including health research) in certain African countries. Methods: This research is conducted across 12 African countries: Botswana, Cameroon, The Gambia, Ghana, Kenya, Malawi, Nigeria, Rwanda, South Africa, Tanzania, Uganda, and Zimbabwe. As limited specific AI legislation is found in these African countries, and because AI is informed by ancillary regulatory frameworks, we include data protection, digital health, consumer protection, and intellectual property in our research. A scoping review method was applied with a manual search of digital libraries with search terms customised for each repository consisting of core search terms for the various topics, including, among others, “law,” “regulation,” “artificial intelligence,” “data protection,” “intellectual property,” and “digital health”. Results and discussion: Analysis of the data demonstrated that while in the African countries under investigation there is no sui generis AI regulation, recent developments were found in areas that inform AI adoption, including in digital health, data protection, consumer protection, and intellectual property. Our findings highlight the fragmentation of the African AI regulatory landscape and illustrate the importance of continued AI regulatory development to ensure that Africa is well positioned for future AI adoption in health."

            "summary": "The rapid advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) have led to the development of sophisticated large language models (LLMs) such as GPT-4 and Bard. The potential implementation of LLMs in healthcare settings has already garnered considerable attention because of their diverse applications that include facilitating clinical documentation, obtaining insurance pre-authorization, summarizing research papers, or working as a chatbot to answer questions for patients about their specific data and concerns. While offering transformative potential, LLMs warrant a very cautious approach since these models are trained differently from AI-based medical technologies that are regulated already, especially within the critical context of caring for patients. The newest version, GPT-4, that was released in March, 2023, brings the potentials of this technology to support multiple medical tasks; and risks from mishandling results it provides to varying reliability to a new level. Besides being an advanced LLM, it will be able to read texts on images and analyze the context of those images. The regulation of GPT-4 and generative AI in medicine and healthcare without damaging their exciting and transformative potential is a timely and critical challenge to ensure safety, maintain ethical standards, and protect patient privacy. We argue that regulatory oversight should assure medical professionals and patients can use LLMs without causing harm or compromising their data or privacy. This paper summarizes our practical recommendations for what we can expect from regulators to bring this vision to reality."

            "summary": "Artificial intelligence (AI), particularly generative AI, has emerged as a transformative tool in healthcare, with the potential to revolutionize clinical decision-making and improve health outcomes. Generative AI, capable of generating new data such as text and images, holds promise in enhancing patient care, revolutionizing disease diagnosis and expanding treatment options. However, the utility and impact of generative AI in healthcare remain poorly understood, with concerns around ethical and medico-legal implications, integration into healthcare service delivery and workforce utilisation. Also, there is not a clear pathway to implement and integrate generative AI in healthcare delivery. This article aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the use of generative AI in healthcare, focusing on the utility of the technology in healthcare and its translational application highlighting the need for careful planning, execution and management of expectations in adopting generative AI in clinical medicine. Key considerations include factors such as data privacy, security and the irreplaceable role of clinicians’ expertise. Frameworks like the technology acceptance model (TAM) and the Non-Adoption, Abandonment, Scale-up, Spread and Sustainability (NASSS) model are considered to promote responsible integration. These frameworks allow anticipating and proactively addressing barriers to adoption, facilitating stakeholder participation and responsibly transitioning care systems to harness generative AI’s potential. Generative AI has the potential to transform healthcare through automated systems, enhanced clinical decision-making and democratization of expertise with diagnostic support tools providing timely, personalized suggestions. Generative AI applications across billing, diagnosis, treatment and research can also make healthcare delivery more efficient, equitable and effective. However, integration of generative AI necessitates meticulous change management and risk mitigation strategies. Technological capabilities alone cannot shift complex care ecosystems overnight; rather, structured adoption programs grounded in implementation science are imperative. It is strongly argued in this article that generative AI can usher in tremendous healthcare progress, if introduced responsibly. Strategic adoption based on implementation science, incremental deployment and balanced messaging around opportunities versus limitations helps promote safe, ethical generative AI integration. Extensive real-world piloting and iteration aligned to clinical priorities should drive development. With conscientious governance centred on human wellbeing over technological novelty, generative AI can enhance accessibility, affordability and quality of care. As these models continue advancing rapidly, ongoing reassessment and transparent communication around their strengths and weaknesses remain vital to restoring trust, realizing positive potential and, most importantly, improving patient outcomes."

            "year": 2023,
            "summary": "Introduction: Artificial intelligence (AI)-enhanced technology has seen unprecedented expansion in the recent past. This growth brings with it huge opportunities for the positive transformation of the economy, business, healthcare, and society. However, a critical question is whether, and to what extent, regulatory measures and mechanisms have been implemented to safeguard its design, development, and deployment. This paper offers a scoping exercise that maps the regulatory landscape of AI in healthcare (including health research) in certain African countries. Methods: This research is conducted across 12 African countries: Botswana, Cameroon, The Gambia, Ghana, Kenya, Malawi, Nigeria, Rwanda, South Africa, Tanzania, Uganda, and Zimbabwe. As limited specific AI legislation is found in these African countries, and because AI is informed by ancillary regulatory frameworks, we include data protection, digital health, consumer protection, and intellectual property in our research. A scoping review method was applied with a manual search of digital libraries with search terms customised for each repository consisting of core search terms for the various topics, including, among others, “law,” “regulation,” “artificial intelligence,” “data protection,” “intellectual property,” and “digital health”. Results and discussion: Analysis of the data demonstrated that while in the African countries under investigation there is no sui generis AI regulation, recent developments were found in areas that inform AI adoption, including in digital health, data protection, consumer protection, and intellectual property. Our findings highlight the fragmentation of the African AI regulatory landscape and illustrate the importance of continued AI regulatory development to ensure that Africa is well positioned for future AI adoption in health."

            "year": 2024,
            "summary": "Abstract Artificial intelligence (AI) provides a unique opportunity to help meet the demands of the future healthcare system. However, hospitals may not be well equipped to handle safe and effective development and/or procurement of AI systems. Furthermore, upcoming regulations such as the EU AI Act may enforce the need to establish new management systems, quality assurance and control mechanisms, novel to healthcare organizations. This paper discusses challenges in AI implementation, particularly potential gaps in current management systems (MS), by reviewing the harmonized standard for AI MS, ISO 42001, as part of a gap analysis of a tertiary acute hospital with ongoing AI activities. Examination of the industry agnostic ISO 42001 reveals a technical debt within healthcare, aligning with previous research on digitalization and AI implementation. To successfully implement AI with quality assurance in mind, emphasis should be put on the foundation and structure of the healthcare organizations, including both workforce and data infrastructure."

            "summary": "Introduction With the current exponential expansion of robotics, implants, and imaging technologies, diagnostic processes within the healthcare industry are becoming popular platforms for artificial intelligence (AI) use. Thus, an understanding of physicians’ attitudes toward AI and the extent to which medical educators are ready to work with AI is necessary. This research aimed to study doctors’ perceptions of AI in healthcare. Methods A web-based questionnaire organized into four sections, namely, demographics, concepts of AI, education in AI, and implementation challenges related to AI, was designed systematically based on a literature search and circulated among medical doctors from various fields. Results Study participants exhibited a lower score toward familiarity with AI. Only 52.12% (74/142) of physicians completed the survey. The greatest challenge associated with the use of AI in therapeutic settings was found to be the degree of autonomy, with a score of 3.56. Among the participants, 67.61% felt that the lack of human supervision was the most important limiting factor in the implementation of AI in clinical practice. However, the participants demonstrated a strong interest in understanding the concepts of AI in the near future. Conclusion This study revealed a low degree of familiarity with AI, highlighting the need for medical schools and hospitals to establish specialized education and training programs for physicians to improve patient outcomes."

            "year": 2024,
            "summary": "Artificial intelligence (AI) has the potential to revolutionize healthcare, for example via decision support systems, computer vision approaches, or AI-based prevention tools. Initial results from AI applications in healthcare show promise but are rarely translated into clinical practice successfully and ethically. This occurs despite an abundance of “Trustworthy AI” guidelines. How can we explain the translational gaps of AI in healthcare? This paper offers a fresh perspective on this problem, showing that failing translation of healthcare AI markedly arises from a lack of an operational definition of “trust” and “trustworthiness”. This leads to (a) unintentional misuse concerning what trust (worthiness) is and (b) the risk of intentional abuse by industry stakeholders engaging in ethics washing. By pointing out these issues, we aim to highlight the obstacles that hinder translation of Trustworthy medical AI to practice and prevent it from fulfilling its unmet promises."

            "summary": "The rapid advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) have led to the development of sophisticated large language models (LLMs) such as GPT-4 and Bard. The potential implementation of LLMs in healthcare settings has already garnered considerable attention because of their diverse applications that include facilitating clinical documentation, obtaining insurance pre-authorization, summarizing research papers, or working as a chatbot to answer questions for patients about their specific data and concerns. While offering transformative potential, LLMs warrant a very cautious approach since these models are trained differently from AI-based medical technologies that are regulated already, especially within the critical context of caring for patients. The newest version, GPT-4, that was released in March, 2023, brings the potentials of this technology to support multiple medical tasks; and risks from mishandling results it provides to varying reliability to a new level. Besides being an advanced LLM, it will be able to read texts on images and analyze the context of those images. The regulation of GPT-4 and generative AI in medicine and healthcare without damaging their exciting and transformative potential is a timely and critical challenge to ensure safety, maintain ethical standards, and protect patient privacy. We argue that regulatory oversight should assure medical professionals and patients can use LLMs without causing harm or compromising their data or privacy. This paper summarizes our practical recommendations for what we can expect from regulators to bring this vision to reality."

            "summary": "Introduction: Artificial intelligence (AI)-enhanced technology has seen unprecedented expansion in the recent past. This growth brings with it huge opportunities for the positive transformation of the economy, business, healthcare, and society. However, a critical question is whether, and to what extent, regulatory measures and mechanisms have been implemented to safeguard its design, development, and deployment. This paper offers a scoping exercise that maps the regulatory landscape of AI in healthcare (including health research) in certain African countries. Methods: This research is conducted across 12 African countries: Botswana, Cameroon, The Gambia, Ghana, Kenya, Malawi, Nigeria, Rwanda, South Africa, Tanzania, Uganda, and Zimbabwe. As limited specific AI legislation is found in these African countries, and because AI is informed by ancillary regulatory frameworks, we include data protection, digital health, consumer protection, and intellectual property in our research. A scoping review method was applied with a manual search of digital libraries with search terms customised for each repository consisting of core search terms for the various topics, including, among others, “law,” “regulation,” “artificial intelligence,” “data protection,” “intellectual property,” and “digital health”. Results and discussion: Analysis of the data demonstrated that while in the African countries under investigation there is no sui generis AI regulation, recent developments were found in areas that inform AI adoption, including in digital health, data protection, consumer protection, and intellectual property. Our findings highlight the fragmentation of the African AI regulatory landscape and illustrate the importance of continued AI regulatory development to ensure that Africa is well positioned for future AI adoption in health."

            "year": 2024,
            "summary": "Artificial intelligence (AI) has the potential to revolutionize healthcare, for example via decision support systems, computer vision approaches, or AI-based prevention tools. Initial results from AI applications in healthcare show promise but are rarely translated into clinical practice successfully and ethically. This occurs despite an abundance of “Trustworthy AI” guidelines. How can we explain the translational gaps of AI in healthcare? This paper offers a fresh perspective on this problem, showing that failing translation of healthcare AI markedly arises from a lack of an operational definition of “trust” and “trustworthiness”. This leads to (a) unintentional misuse concerning what trust (worthiness) is and (b) the risk of intentional abuse by industry stakeholders engaging in ethics washing. By pointing out these issues, we aim to highlight the obstacles that hinder translation of Trustworthy medical AI to practice and prevent it from fulfilling its unmet promises."

ARIF-GH will employ a hybrid, iterative methodology combining simulated regulatory environments with real-world pilot deployments. Firstly, it will leverage existing regulatory data from 12 African countries, augmented with expert simulations of emerging AI technologies and potential misuse scenarios, to develop dynamic, modular regulatory guidelines that address sui generis challenges and GDPR/HIPAA-like concerns. Concurrently, ARIF-GH will implement a phased, controlled pilot program within select African healthcare facilities, utilizing a mixed-methods approach including TAM and NASSS-informed surveys and qualitative interviews with healthcare professionals to assess trust, adoption, and workforce integration. Crucially, this pilot will incorporate a \"Human-in-the-Loop\" (HITL) monitoring system, dynamically adjusting AI autonomy based on performance metrics and ethical assessments, directly addressing concerns about patient safety, hallucination, and the degree of AI autonomy. The generated insights will feed back into the simulated regulatory environment, creating a continuous loop of adaptation and refinement, and will be disseminated through specialized training modules for physicians, addressing the identified knowledge gaps and ensuring the safe, ethical, and effective integration of generative AI into complex African healthcare ecosystems.",

            "summary": "The rapid advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) have led to the development of sophisticated large language models (LLMs) such as GPT-4 and Bard. The potential implementation of LLMs in healthcare settings has already garnered considerable attention because of their diverse applications that include facilitating clinical documentation, obtaining insurance pre-authorization, summarizing research papers, or working as a chatbot to answer questions for patients about their specific data and concerns. While offering transformative potential, LLMs warrant a very cautious approach since these models are trained differently from AI-based medical technologies that are regulated already, especially within the critical context of caring for patients. The newest version, GPT-4, that was released in March, 2023, brings the potentials of this technology to support multiple medical tasks; and risks from mishandling results it provides to varying reliability to a new level. Besides being an advanced LLM, it will be able to read texts on images and analyze the context of those images. The regulation of GPT-4 and generative AI in medicine and healthcare without damaging their exciting and transformative potential is a timely and critical challenge to ensure safety, maintain ethical standards, and protect patient privacy. We argue that regulatory oversight should assure medical professionals and patients can use LLMs without causing harm or compromising their data or privacy. This paper summarizes our practical recommendations for what we can expect from regulators to bring this vision to reality."

            "summary": "Artificial intelligence (AI), particularly generative AI, has emerged as a transformative tool in healthcare, with the potential to revolutionize clinical decision-making and improve health outcomes. Generative AI, capable of generating new data such as text and images, holds promise in enhancing patient care, revolutionizing disease diagnosis and expanding treatment options. However, the utility and impact of generative AI in healthcare remain poorly understood, with concerns around ethical and medico-legal implications, integration into healthcare service delivery and workforce utilisation. Also, there is not a clear pathway to implement and integrate generative AI in healthcare delivery. This article aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the use of generative AI in healthcare, focusing on the utility of the technology in healthcare and its translational application highlighting the need for careful planning, execution and management of expectations in adopting generative AI in clinical medicine. Key considerations include factors such as data privacy, security and the irreplaceable role of clinicians’ expertise. Frameworks like the technology acceptance model (TAM) and the Non-Adoption, Abandonment, Scale-up, Spread and Sustainability (NASSS) model are considered to promote responsible integration. These frameworks allow anticipating and proactively addressing barriers to adoption, facilitating stakeholder participation and responsibly transitioning care systems to harness generative AI’s potential. Generative AI has the potential to transform healthcare through automated systems, enhanced clinical decision-making and democratization of expertise with diagnostic support tools providing timely, personalized suggestions. Generative AI applications across billing, diagnosis, treatment and research can also make healthcare delivery more efficient, equitable and effective. However, integration of generative AI necessitates meticulous change management and risk mitigation strategies.

            "year": 2023,
            "summary": "Introduction: Artificial intelligence (AI)-enhanced technology has seen unprecedented expansion in the recent past. This growth brings with it huge opportunities for the positive transformation of the economy, business, healthcare, and society. However, a critical question is whether, and to what extent, regulatory measures and mechanisms have been implemented to safeguard its design, development, and deployment. This paper offers a scoping exercise that maps the regulatory landscape of AI in healthcare (including health research) in certain African countries. Methods: This research is conducted across 12 African countries: Botswana, Cameroon, The Gambia, Ghana, Kenya, Malawi, Nigeria, Rwanda, South Africa, Tanzania, Uganda, and Zimbabwe. As limited specific AI legislation is found in these African countries, and because AI is informed by ancillary regulatory frameworks, we include data protection, digital health, consumer protection, and intellectual property in our research. A scoping review method was applied with a manual search of digital libraries with search terms customised for each repository consisting of core search terms for the various topics, including, among others, “law,” “regulation,” “artificial intelligence,” “data protection,” “intellectual property,” and “digital health”. Results and discussion: Analysis of the data demonstrated that while in the African countries under investigation there is no sui generis AI regulation, recent developments were found in areas that inform AI adoption, including in digital health, data protection, consumer protection, and intellectual property. Our findings highlight the fragmentation of the African AI regulatory landscape and illustrate the importance of continued AI regulatory development to ensure that Africa is well positioned for future AI adoption in health."

            "summary": "Artificial intelligence (AI) has the potential to revolutionize healthcare, for example via decision support systems, computer vision approaches, or AI-based prevention tools. Initial results from AI applications in healthcare show promise but are rarely translated into clinical practice successfully and ethically. This occurs despite an abundance of “Trustworthy AI” guidelines. How can we explain the translational gaps of AI in healthcare? This paper offers a fresh perspective on this problem, showing that failing translation of healthcare AI markedly arises from a lack of an operational definition of “trust” and “trustworthiness”. This leads to (a) unintentional misuse concerning what trust (worthiness) is and (b) the risk of intentional abuse by industry stakeholders engaging in ethics washing. By pointing out these issues, we aim to highlight the obstacles that hinder translation of Trustworthy medical AI to practice and prevent it from fulfilling its unmet promises."

            "summary": "The rapid advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) have led to the development of sophisticated large language models (LLMs) such as GPT-4 and Bard. The potential implementation of LLMs in healthcare settings has already garnered considerable attention because of their diverse applications that include facilitating clinical documentation, obtaining insurance pre-authorization, summarizing research papers, or working as a chatbot to answer questions for patients about their specific data and concerns. While offering transformative potential, LLMs warrant a very cautious approach since these models are trained differently from AI-based medical technologies that are regulated already, especially within the critical context of caring for patients. The newest version, GPT-4, that was released in March, 2023, brings the potentials of this technology to support multiple medical tasks; and risks from mishandling results it provides to varying reliability to a new level. Besides being an advanced LLM, it will be able to read texts on images and analyze the context of those images. The regulation of GPT-4 and generative AI in medicine and healthcare without damaging their exciting and transformative potential is a timely and critical challenge to ensure safety, maintain ethical standards, and protect patient privacy. We argue that regulatory oversight should assure medical professionals and patients can use LLMs without causing harm or compromising their data or privacy. This paper summarizes our practical recommendations for what we can expect from regulators to bring this vision to reality."

            "summary": "Artificial intelligence (AI), particularly generative AI, has emerged as a transformative tool in healthcare, with the potential to revolutionize clinical decision-making and improve health outcomes. Generative AI, capable of generating new data such as text and images, holds promise in enhancing patient care, revolutionizing disease diagnosis and expanding treatment options. However, the utility and impact of generative AI in healthcare remain poorly understood, with concerns around ethical and medico-legal implications, integration into healthcare service delivery and workforce utilisation. Also, there is not a clear pathway to implement and integrate generative AI in healthcare delivery. This article aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the use of generative AI in healthcare, focusing on the utility of the technology in healthcare and its translational application highlighting the need for careful planning, execution and management of expectations in adopting generative AI in clinical medicine. Key considerations include factors such as data privacy, security and the irreplaceable role of clinicians’ expertise. Frameworks like the technology acceptance model (TAM) and the Non-Adoption, Abandonment, Scale-up, Spread and Sustainability (NASSS) model are considered to promote responsible integration. These frameworks allow anticipating and proactively addressing barriers to adoption, facilitating stakeholder participation and responsibly transitioning care systems to harness generative AI’s potential. Generative AI has the potential to transform healthcare through automated systems, enhanced clinical decision-making and democratization of expertise with diagnostic support tools providing timely, personalized suggestions. Generative AI applications across billing, diagnosis, treatment and research can also make healthcare delivery more efficient, equitable and effective. However, integration of generative AI necessitates meticulous change management and risk mitigation strategies. Technological capabilities alone cannot shift complex care ecosystems overnight; rather, structured adoption programs grounded in implementation science are imperative. It is strongly argued in this article that generative AI can usher in tremendous healthcare progress, if introduced responsibly. Strategic adoption based on implementation science, incremental deployment and balanced messaging around opportunities versus limitations helps promote safe, ethical generative AI integration. Extensive real-world piloting and iteration aligned to clinical priorities should drive development. With conscientious governance centred on human wellbeing over technological novelty, generative AI can enhance accessibility, affordability and quality of care. As these models continue advancing rapidly, ongoing reassessment and transparent communication around their strengths and weaknesses remain vital to restoring trust, realizing positive potential and, most importantly, improving patient outcomes."

            "summary": "Introduction: Artificial intelligence (AI)-enhanced technology has seen unprecedented expansion in the recent past. This growth brings with it huge opportunities for the positive transformation of the economy, business, healthcare, and society. However, a critical question is whether, and to what extent, regulatory measures and mechanisms have been implemented to safeguard its design, development, and deployment. This paper offers a scoping exercise that maps the regulatory landscape of AI in healthcare (including health research) in certain African countries. Methods: This research is conducted across 12 African countries: Botswana, Cameroon, The Gambia, Ghana, Kenya, Malawi, Nigeria, Rwanda, South Africa, Tanzania, Uganda, and Zimbabwe. As limited specific AI legislation is found in these African countries, and because AI is informed by ancillary regulatory frameworks, we include data protection, digital health, consumer protection, and intellectual property in our research. A scoping review method was applied with a manual search of digital libraries with search terms customised for each repository consisting of core search terms for the various topics, including, among others, “law,” “regulation,” “artificial intelligence,” “data protection,” “intellectual property,” and “digital health”. Results and discussion: Analysis of the data demonstrated that while in the African countries under investigation there is no sui generis AI regulation, recent developments were found in areas that inform AI adoption, including in digital health, data protection, consumer protection, and intellectual property. Our findings highlight the fragmentation of the African AI regulatory landscape and illustrate the importance of continued AI regulatory development to ensure that Africa is well positioned for future AI adoption in health."

            "summary": "Artificial intelligence (AI) has the potential to revolutionize healthcare, for example via decision support systems, computer vision approaches, or AI-based prevention tools. Initial results from AI applications in healthcare show promise but are rarely translated into clinical practice successfully and ethically. This occurs despite an abundance of “Trustworthy AI” guidelines. How can we explain the translational gaps of AI in healthcare? This paper offers a fresh perspective on this problem, showing that failing translation of healthcare AI markedly arises from a lack of an operational definition of “trust” and “trustworthiness”. This leads to (a) unintentional misuse concerning what trust (worthiness) is and (b) the risk of intentional abuse by industry stakeholders engaging in ethics washing. By pointing out these issues, we aim to highlight the obstacles that hinder translation of Trustworthy medical AI to practice and prevent it from fulfilling its unmet promises."

            "summary": "This theoretical examination explores the challenges and approaches to establishing ethical frameworks for the integration of artificial intelligence (AI) in healthcare entrepreneurship. As AI technologies continue to advance, their applications in healthcare hold immense potential for improving patient outcomes and driving innovation. However, ethical considerations are paramount to ensure the responsible and equitable deployment of AI-driven solutions. This paper delves into key ethical dimensions including privacy and data security, bias and fairness, accountability and transparency, and patient autonomy and consent. It identifies challenges such as technological limitations, regulatory complexities, and organizational barriers that impede the implementation of ethical frameworks. Additionally, it proposes approaches including collaborative governance models, ethical design practices, and continuous monitoring and evaluation to address these challenges. Through case studies and examples, the paper illustrates successful implementations of ethical frameworks in AI healthcare startups, highlighting lessons learned and their impact on patient outcomes and trust. Ultimately, this examination underscores the critical importance of ethical considerations in shaping the future of AI in healthcare entrepreneurship and provides insights for researchers, practitioners, and policymakers navigating this rapidly evolving landscape."

            "summary": "Among all the application areas of the time-series prediction, stock market prediction is the most challenging task due to its dynamic nature, and dependency on many volatile factors. The unpredictable fatal events called Black Swan events also highly influence the stock market. If the successful stock trends prediction is achieved, then the investors can adopt a more appropriate trading strategy, and that can significantly reduce the risk of investment. In this work, a time-efficient hybrid stock trends prediction framework(HSTPF) is proposed to successfully predict the future trends of the stock market even during the periods of Black Swan events. Here, to improve the prediction accuracy of HSTPF, the Black Swan events analysis and features selection operations are performed, and also the performance of various machine learning classifiers are analyzed. A vast number of experiments are conducted on the two real-world stock market datasets S&P BSE SENSEX and Nifty 50, to analyze the performance of the proposed framework. The framework is applied for the single-step and multi-step ahead predictions. The experimental results show that the proposed framework produces over 86% of accuracy, and during the Black Swan events, its accuracy is almost 80% for single-step ahead predictions. For the multi-step ahead of predictions, the HSTPF is produced satisfactory results. The framework also outperforms other existing similar works even during the Black Swan events in terms of prediction accuracy, and its computational time is also very low."

It helps identify the opinion, attitude, and tone of a text categorizing it into positive, negative, or neutral. SA is frequently used today as more and more people get a chance to put out their thoughts due to the advent of social media. Sentiment analysis benefits industries around the globe, like finance, advertising, marketing, travel, hospitality, etc. Although the majority of work done in this field is on global languages like English, in recent years, the importance of SA in local languages has also been widely recognized. This has led to considerable research in the analysis of Indian regional languages. This paper comprehensively reviews SA in the following major Indian Regional languages: Marathi, Hindi, Tamil, Telugu, Malayalam, Bengali, Gujarati, and Urdu. Furthermore, this paper presents techniques, challenges, findings, recent research trends, and future scope for enhancing results accuracy."

Methodology: A total of 641 dental patent applications retrieved from the Indian Government Official Website between 2010 and 2020 were scanned for field of invention, type or status of application along with details regarding date of publication or filing of application, etc., The dataset was collaboratively analyzed using Panda's Library in Python software as analysis tool for data preparation and frequency analysis. The estimates were presented as mean differences and 95% confidence intervals. Results: The results showed that Indian Patent Office (IPO) has granted 54 dental patents in the last decade. The maximum applications of the IPO processes are the patent co-operation treaty National Phase applications (53.3%), mostly in the bio-engineering field (36.8%). Chiefly, patents were filed by individuals and companies (n = 180) and average time for grant was 4.90 years and 5.34 years, respectively. Conclusion: The process of patent application in India although has become digitalized needs to be more comprehensible and time bound, with more awareness disseminated to entrepreneurs and dental students alike."

            "year": 2024,
            "summary": "Medicinal plants have been a cornerstone of healthcare practices globally, serving a significant population in developing countries who rely on affordable herbal remedies. However, the current marketing system through Mandis and wholesale markets suffers from opacity. Numerous intermediaries create an information gap for farmers regarding fair pricing and market trends. Additionally, concerns exist about misidentification and adulteration of medicinal plants due to limited knowledge among collectors and traders. The National Medicinal Plants Board (NMPB) recognizes the need for a robust supply chain. This paper proposes a blockchain-based platform ‘Indian Herbal Blockchain Network (IHBN)’ integrated with Deep Learning for image processing. The deep learning model has achieved a decent accuracy of 90.24% which decreases the chance of misidentification. The platform ensures transparent traceability of medicinal plants from source to consumer, along with accurate identification using image analysis. This system promotes transparency within the medicinal plant supply chain, reducing the risk of adulteration and improving overall trust."

            "summary": "Abstract- The study looks into the role of digital marketing in Indian rural areas by analyzing consumers and the limits of market access. Surveys, interviews, and case studies were used by adopting a mixed-methods methodology. According to the findings, rural consumers use smartphones regularly (72%), and this group also uses social media each day (68%). On top of that, WhatsApp and YouTube appear to be the key platforms among them. Evidence from regression analysis proves that urban exposure to digital ads positively affects people’s purchase habits. While the industry has become bigger, society still deals with challenges such as those involving information technology and trust. The research suggests that having content in different languages and making targeted strategies on key platforms will help engage more people living in rural areas. This research reveals how digital marketing strategies can open up many opportunities for rural India, making it useful for businesses that want to pursue growth in the area.\n\nKeywords- Digital Marketing, Rural India, Consumer Behavior, Market Reach, Social Media, Smartphone Penetration, Digital Advertising."

It consists of the automatic identification of sentiment in articles using NLP models, which might give businesses, decision-makers, and the general public information that is helpful. Many NLP models have been published in this field for the sentiment analysis of online news articles. Some of the models in this area include VADER, TextBlob, Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Naive Bayes, Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), and Transformer-based models. The rule-based technology VADER provides sentiment scores to the text’s words. TextBlob classifies a text’s sentiment using machine learning methods. The methods for probabilistic machine learning Text are categorized using Naive Bayes and SVM based on the frequency of phrases. RNNs analyze text one word at a time and use the previous words to predict how the next word will sound. Transformer-based models can be customized for sentiment analysis and come pre-trained on a lot of text, including BERT, RoBERTa, and GPT-2. The model selection depends on the project’s unique requirements. Overall, NLP models for sentiment analysis of online news articles have the potential to offer insightful information for decision-making across a range of fields. In this paper, the review of different approaches and models for performing sentiment classification on online news articles is provided and the reader may be able to find the application of sentiment analysis in the domains of their interest."

            "summary": "Sentiment analysis is a valuable method for gauging people’s sentiments and emotions towards various subjects. Within this realm, emotion detection stands out by predicting specific emotions rather than categorizing them broadly as positive, negative, or neutral. While previous research has predominantly focused on emotion recognition through speech and facial expressions, text-based emotion detection poses distinct challenges due to the absence of cues like tonal stress and facial expressions. Addressing these challenges, natural language processing (NLP) techniques have been employed in the past, including the keyword approach, lexicon-based approach, and machine learning approach. However, keyword- and lexicon-based strategies have limitations, particularly in handling semantic relations. In this study, a propose novel hybrid model that combines machine learning and deep learning, specifically utilizing a sequential neural network architecture. The model includes embedding layers, flattening, and dense layers. The effectiveness of our approach is demonstrated through training on a diverse dataset encompassing sentences, tweets, and dialogs. Remarkably, our model achieves a high accuracy of the validation data, underscoring its efficacy in text-based emotion detection without relying on existing content."

Based on the parallel hybrid network and the two-way attention mechanism, an improved text sentiment analysis model is proposed. The model first takes the word vector trained by the BERT language model as the input, and then extracts the global and local features of the context simultaneously through the parallel hybrid neural network constructed by the Convolution Neural Network (CNN) and The Bidirectional Gated Recurrent Unit (BiGRU), so as to improve the feature extraction ability of the model. It also integrates the dual-way attention mechanism to strengthen the key information in the global feature and local feature, and the feature vectors obtained by feature fusion are used for sentiment analysis. The experimental results on the ChnSentiCorp hotel review data set and the NLPcc2013-NLPcc2014 microblog review data set show that the model has significantly improved the classification accuracy compared with the benchmark model."

            "summary": "The usage of online recommender systems in health-care, pharmaceuticals, and hospitals is growing. Nowadays, the vast majority of consumers research potential prescriptions online before consulting their doctors for a variety of medical issues. Modern drug recommendation systems frequently pay no attention to the unique needs of a patient and don’t wait for the expectations of the patient. To this, we propose a novel hybrid ensemble model that incorporates Deep Learning, Machine Learning, and Sentiment Analysis. The contribution of the TensorFlow/Keras neural network is in drug review analysis for sentiment, meanwhile LightGBM classifier that offers an alternative approach is another part of the network. Besides TextBlob and a dictionary-based annotation approach, machine learning taking place during classification brings value to sentiment analysis. Forecasts of authorities are pooled, weighted by review influence, and clashed to produce drug-specific studies. This multi-faceted strategy is better compartmentalized and tailor to each patient’s needs, taking emotional state into account, thereby patients are able to access more accurate drug advice and healthcare professionals to make informed decision. Qualitative analysis of the efficiency the model will be carried out using the confusion matrices. Thus, by means of the research on hand, we expect the transformation of the drug recommendation system taking into consideration and patient-individualized system, which will contribute to the improvement of healthcare delivery."

            "summary": "This paper applies a novel sentiment analysis method to the IMDB movie review dataset by integrating Lipschitz Recurrent Neural Networks (LRNN) into a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) architecture. Traditional sentiment analysis techniques frequently struggle with instability and disappearing gradients during model training. Our method reduces these problems by using LRNN's stability and effectiveness, improving sentiment analysis's precision and resilience. The GAN framework efficiently synthesizes and discriminates between real and generated sentiment-laden textual data. It consists of a generator and discriminator that are both equipped with LRNN. The discriminator distinguishes between real and fake data and rates the sentiment correctness of the generated text, while the generator concentrates on producing realistic, sentiment-laden prose. A typical issue in traditional GAN models, the gradient vanishing problem is addressed by integrating LRNN in both the generator and discriminator, stabilizing the training process and enhancing performance. With an accuracy of 91.30 % on the IMDB dataset, our results significantly improve sentiment analysis accuracy, surpassing some well-known models. This indicates that LRNN-based GAN models can effectively handle challenging sentiment analysis tasks. Subsequent investigations will delve into the utilization of this paradigm in industry-specific settings like healthcare, banking, and education, as well as its incorporation into chatbot platforms. This work advances sentiment analysis techniques by providing a reliable and effective method for analyzing sentiments in big datasets."

            "summary": "Machine translation is the act of translating from one language to another using a computer program or algorithm. The need for translation from one language to another to facilitate communication between different cultures and peoplei s one that we have had since antiquity. Traditional methods of translation are quite slow and cumbersome and are susceptible to biases from the translator. The advent of computers has led us to explore ways in which this process may be automated. Another long-standing problem is the detection and classification of emotions in textual data. The capacity to detect and recognize human emotions is one that is particularly fascinating and important in the field of Artificial Intelligence. Both problems are NLP(natural language processing) problems that involve analyzing textual data which is inherently sequential in nature. Traditional deep neural networks have proven inefficient and inaccurate in tasks involving sequential data such as natural language processing, time series analysis etc. Over the years numerous deep learning models have been developed to address these issues. The advent of RNNs(Recurrent Neural Networks), LSTMs(Long Short-Term Memory) and GRUs(Gated Recurrent Units), which are all deep neural networks built to handle sequential data, has made great progress in machine translation and sentiment analysis. Each of these models has its own unique characteristics and features. This paper aims to compare each model in terms of accuracy, performance, architecture, computational complexity, etc. and thus outline situations in which each model may prove suitable based on its particular set of strengths and weaknesses."

The major processes involved for the developed sentiment analysis approach are tokenization and sentiment classification. Initially, the input reviews are considered from the database and are subjected to the tokenization process. The tokenization process is performed using Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformer (BERT) where the input review data is partitioned into individual words, named as tokens. Finally, sentiment classification is carried out using Attention-based Bidirectional CNN-RNN Deep Model (ABCDM), which is trained by proposed Chimp Deer Hunting Optimization (CDHO) approach. Accordingly, the proposed CDHO algorithm is newly designed by incorporating Chimp Optimization Algorithm (ChOA) and Deer Hunting Optimization Algorithm (DHOA). The proposed CDHO-based ABCDM provided enhanced performance with highest precision of 93.5%, recall of 94.5% and F-measure of 94%."

KIA-GAN-EBM addresses multiple research gaps by: **1) Explicitly incorporating key information identification** into the generative process, allowing the model to learn how specific entities or phrases (e.g., product features, service aspects) influence overall sentiment, thereby tackling the failure to consider key information's impact. **2) Integrating a multi-objective optimization framework** within the GAN's training loop to simultaneously maximize sentiment classification accuracy and minimize detected biases (e.g., gender, racial) based on fairness metrics, directly addressing ethical concerns. **3) Employing a hierarchical feature extraction architecture** that combines transformer-based contextual embeddings (BERT) with graph convolutional networks (GCNs) to capture complex semantic relations and incomplete text features more effectively than current methods. **4) Leveraging a novel data augmentation strategy** using the generator to synthesize diverse, balanced datasets with controlled levels of neutrality and negativity, mitigating dataset imbalances and improving detection of these nuances. **5) Designing a modular and interpretable architecture** with attention mechanisms and explainable AI techniques to address integration concerns and provide insights into model decisions, laying the groundwork for more scalable and trustworthy sentiment analysis systems."
