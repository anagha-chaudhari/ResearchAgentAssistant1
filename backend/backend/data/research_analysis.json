Crucially, this unified framework will incorporate a novel real-time guided wave analysis module, utilizing complex-valued wavenumber domain analysis and eigenvector shape analysis on simulated and measured wave data, to non-destructively evaluate bonding status and detect tensile stress relaxation mechanisms, thereby informing design margin policies and enabling early fault detection for active TPS configurations.

TU-CEDT will integrate advanced uncertainty quantification techniques, such as Bayesian inference and stochastic collocation on polynomial chaos expansions, directly within a coupled thermomechanical and electromagnetic finite element framework. This will enable a fundamental understanding of feasible wave mode selection for TPS bonding status evaluation by analyzing the probabilistic variations in material properties and reentry conditions. The methodology will leverage pore-scale simulations and advanced surrogate modeling, such as Deep Gaussian Process Regression informed by augmented snapshot matrices, to efficiently analyze uncertain TPS under thermomechanical coupling, going beyond scalar random variables. The digital twin will be augmented with both experimental and high-fidelity simulation data for a diverse range of TPS materials and reentry scenarios, facilitating robust reliability assessment and informing design margin policies. Experimental validation will be a core component, utilizing a high-temperature heating and arc wind tunnel to generate comprehensive datasets for model calibration and verification, specifically addressing the gap in validation with real-world data and exploring the impact of tensile stress relaxation mechanisms. Furthermore, the TU-CEDT will explore the optimization of various conformal CP antenna types beyond spiral antennas and investigate asymmetric designs for different curvatures and frequency bands, providing a holistic approach to designing resilient and high-performance conformal TPS antenna systems."

We will extend existing affine-based interval finite element methods (AIFEM) and perturbed-based interval finite element methods (PIFEM) to explicitly capture uncertainties in thermomechanical coupling during TPS assembly, explicitly quantifying dispersion and informing design margin policies. This will be achieved by developing a high-fidelity digital twin incorporating not only thermal and mechanical properties but also detailed assembly variations (clearance, step-off) derived from a comprehensive assembly pose dataset and advanced metrology techniques like tomographic imaging. To bridge the gap between simulation and practical implementation, we will employ a multi-modal sensor network (e.g., infrared thermography, eddy current testing, ultrasonic phased arrays) on fabricated TPS assemblies to generate real-time, high-resolution data. This data will then be used to train physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) that can predict both the thermal dispersion under varying operational conditions and the impact on antenna radiation performance (gain, AR, main lobe splitting) with unprecedented accuracy and speed, overcoming the limitations of traditional equivalent analytical equations and decoupling methods, and providing a pathway for evaluating TPS assembly quality in near real-time. We will establish quantitative baselines by comparing our predictions against both simulated data from advanced CFD solvers and rigorous experimental validation on complex, real-world TPS configurations, focusing on broadband applications and exploring the trade-offs between radiation efficiency and performance degradation."

The PIHDT integrates advanced computational techniques to address the identified research gaps, moving beyond isolated simulations and experiments. It begins with **generative adversarial physics-informed neural networks (GAN-PINNs)** trained on existing simulation data (flow-thermal, material response, dispersion loci) and limited experimental measurements (heating, antenna performance) to create high-fidelity, data-driven surrogate models of TPS behavior under extreme reentry conditions, explicitly accounting for dispersion effects and tensile stress relaxation. These surrogate models inform a **multi-objective digital twin** capable of real-time performance prediction and optimization, considering not only antenna parameters (AR, radiation pattern) but also novel objectives like thermal efficiency and material cost. The digital twin is further enhanced by a **probabilistic assembly deviation model** that couples with the PIHDT's predictive capabilities to quantify the impact of manufacturing imperfections on antenna performance and TPS integrity, enabling robust design margin policies. Finally, the PIHDT framework facilitates **active learning-driven experimental validation**, strategically guiding the fabrication and testing of optimized antenna-TPS configurations and novel active TPS designs, thus generating targeted datasets to further refine the surrogate models and enhance the accuracy and efficiency of TPS assembly quality assessment. This holistic approach aims to provide a comprehensive and predictive methodology for designing high-performance conformal antennas in challenging high-temperature environments."

Unlike previous approaches that relied heavily on direct material transfer and established manufacturing, this methodology will employ high-fidelity computational fluid dynamics (CFD) and finite element analysis (FEA) coupled with a digital twin framework. This framework will be populated with data generated from experimental characterization of Apollo Avcoat and Space Shuttle tile materials under a wide range of simulated re-entry conditions, including non-uniform heating and aerodynamic loads. Furthermore, we will introduce a novel machine learning component to predict material degradation and structural integrity by analyzing the output from these high-fidelity simulations, aiming to bridge the gap left by the absence of existing datasets and proactively identify potential failure modes. The resulting models will inform generative design algorithms, enabling the exploration of entirely new TPS architectures and material combinations that move beyond direct replication of historical solutions, thereby addressing the implicit gap of not having explicit future-oriented design strategies."

The ML component would learn the complex relationships between material properties, structural configurations, and thermal performance, enabling rapid design exploration and identification of optimal material combinations and assembly techniques. Furthermore, a key innovation would be the development of physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) to ensure that learned relationships adhere to fundamental thermodynamic and thermochemical principles, thereby increasing the interpretability and reliability of the model for critical spaceflight applications. This framework would facilitate the prediction of TPS performance under novel mission environments not directly experienced by Apollo or Shuttle, and could be trained to predict the degradation of TPS over multiple missions, thereby addressing the implicit need for more sustainable and reusable TPS solutions without explicitly stated gaps."

This approach directly addresses the research gaps concerning the non-uniformity of pore distribution and the computational expense of mesoscale simulations by employing a multi-scale fractal representation of the pore structure, derived from SEM and potentially photogrammetric data, to inform a computationally efficient effective diffusion model. This fractal model will be integrated into a progressive complexity framework, allowing for adaptive refinement of pyrolysis and gasification sub-models based on iterative data fitting from experimental campaigns. To overcome the limited access to specialized ablative materials for laboratory experiments, we will focus on developing and characterizing a standardized, manufacturable carbon-fiber reinforced composite, akin to HARLEM, utilizing readily available precursors and a simplified impregnation process. The model will be validated through a joint experimental study involving arcjet testing, thermography, and photogrammetry for surface temperature and recession rate measurements, with collected data feeding into a gradient-informed Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) framework to simultaneously identify key thermophysical parameters and quantify uncertainties, providing a more robust and physically grounded prediction of ablation rates compared to traditional methods."

Leveraging the extracted gaps, our methodology will integrate deep generative models with established physical principles to address the complex interplay between TPS properties and antenna performance under hypersonic flight conditions.  Specifically, the PI-GAN will be trained on a multi-modal dataset combining existing simulation results, high-temperature heating experiment data, and assembly pose datasets, augmented by pore-scale numerical simulations of TPS microstructures.  The \"physics-informed\" aspect will ensure the generator respects fundamental electromagnetic wave propagation laws and thermomechanical coupling equations, implicitly addressing performance degradation, AR deterioration, main lobe splitting, and wave mode selection gaps.  The adversarial training will push the generator to produce novel TPS designs, including advanced triply periodic minimal surfaces with tunable geometric parameters and material properties, and corresponding antenna configurations that minimize performance loss, thereby addressing the limited solutions for antenna design under conformal TPS and the need for compact, high-performance designs.  Crucially, the trained PI-GAN will be capable of generating surrogate models for efficient and accurate real-time measurement of assembly quality by learning the correlation between assembly deviations and predicted antenna performance, thus bridging the gap in assembly quality assessment.  Furthermore, the model will be designed to predict the impact of simulated debonding conditions on antenna performance, offering a new avenue for understanding wave mode responses and enabling proactive repair strategies.  This PI-GAN framework will also inherently incorporate uncertainty quantification by learning the stochastic nature of thermal response from the high-temperature heating data and numerical simulations, providing a robust method for thermomechanical coupled uncertainty analysis.  Finally, by generating optimized TPS material compositions or structural modifications that inherently mitigate antenna degradation without altering external profiles, this approach directly tackles the need for repair solutions without structural modification."

AMSST leverages a dual-architecture: an adaptive State Space Model (SSM) backbone to efficiently handle long-range dependencies and variable-length sequences, addressing limitations in copying and retrieving information across substantial contexts, and a flexible Transformer-decoder for local refinement and multi-modal fusion. The SSM component will incorporate novel techniques for dynamic latent state resizing and cross-frequency learning, enabling it to accommodate an arbitrary number of variates and varying distributional properties in time series data, while also mitigating the quadratic scaling issues of pure Transformers on long protein sequences. For image synthesis, AMSST will integrate a rectified flow module with improved noise sampling strategies, designed for efficient high-resolution generation on consumer hardware by biasing sampling towards perceptually relevant scales. The Transformer decoder will be enhanced with attention mechanisms that explicitly learn variate-centric representations and integrate multi-modal information by treating image patches and text tokens distinctly, thus overcoming the meaningless attention map problem and better handling multimodal information for text-to-image synthesis. This methodology aims to achieve state-of-the-art performance across diverse tasks by synergistically combining the strengths of SSMs and Transformers, while offering significant improvements in computational efficiency and scalability."

We hypothesize that by training a unified model that leverages CNNs for efficient local feature extraction and typography handling in text-to-image tasks, and SSMs (specifically a refined Mamba variant) for efficient, long-range context handling in language and time series, we can overcome the performance gaps and computational bottlenecks of current Transformer-based approaches. For text-to-image generation, we will adapt Linear Diffusion Transformers with REPA regularization, biasing their noise sampling towards perceptually relevant scales inspired by rectified flow, and employ decoupled image and text modality embeddings to facilitate better cross-modal understanding. For time series, we will extend the Inverted Transformer architecture by applying CNNs to variate-centric tokens and incorporating a temporal self-attention mechanism for historical fusion, enabling universal forecasting models capable of handling arbitrary variate counts and cross-frequency learning. Crucially, this UMRLG framework will be trained using a novel, multi-objective pretraining strategy that jointly optimizes for representation quality (inspired by self-supervised learning) and generative fidelity, and further enhanced by a deep compression autoencoder to enable efficient high-resolution synthesis. This methodology aims to bridge the gap between the representational power of diffusion models and the efficiency of SSMs and CNNs, leading to more performant, scalable, and computationally efficient models across a diverse range of AI tasks, with a particular focus on text-to-image generation with improved text comprehension and time series forecasting with robust cross-variate and cross-frequency learning."

HV-SST will leverage the linear scalability of State Space Models (SSMs) at its core to handle extremely long sequences, directly tackling the quadratic scaling limitations of traditional Transformers and the scalability issues of linear attention to high resolutions. Within this SSM backbone, we introduce a hierarchical attention mechanism that first applies variate-centric feed-forward networks to individual variate tokens, fostering better variate-specific representation learning, before employing a novel structured attention variant for cross-variate and temporal fusion. This structured attention will be informed by recent advancements in GSSMs and rectified flow concepts, aiming to improve copying and retrieval capabilities beyond current SSMs. Furthermore, we will investigate a multi-stage pretraining strategy that disentangles representation learning tasks from downstream forecasting or generation objectives, mirroring the success of masked language modeling but adapted for multi-variate sequences and potentially incorporating elements of rectified flow noise sampling for improved generative fidelity. Our evaluation will span challenging time series forecasting benchmarks with large lookback windows, and a modified text-to-image generation task focusing on fine-grained textual control and typological accuracy, comparing our approach against state-of-the-art Transformers, Mamba variants, and existing diffusion models, while also exploring the potential of CNN-inspired local processing modules within the hierarchical structure for tasks where local feature extraction is paramount, such as protein sequence pretraining."

VA-SST will employ an SSM backbone for efficient processing of long sequences, overcoming the quadratic scaling limitations of Transformers and improving efficiency and generalization on copying tasks, particularly on large-scale time-series and protein sequence data. To counter the fixed-size latent state limitations of GSSMs and the fused embedding issue in Transformers, VA-SST will introduce a \"variate-centric\" attention mechanism where each variate (e.g., amino acid, time step) has its own learned latent representation, allowing for richer, disentangled embeddings. This mechanism will leverage SSM duality principles to enable effective bidirectional information flow between these variate representations. Furthermore, VA-SST will incorporate a novel bridging module that translates these learned variate-centric representations into a latent space suitable for diffusion models, enabling high-quality, efficient, and potentially smaller text-to-image synthesis on consumer hardware by addressing representation learning bottlenecks and accelerating convergence. By disentangling architectural choices from pretraining tasks, we will investigate the impact of this hybrid architecture on representation learning quality and its correlation with downstream tasks, aiming to bridge the performance gap between Transformer and SSM-based LLMs and establish a more robust understanding of their theoretical underpinnings."

The quantification of order-chaos boundaries will be achieved by linking these period spacings to a prolateness parameter, going beyond traditional Lyapunov exponent analysis to map resonance structures with unprecedented fidelity, and this will be validated against high-resolution observational data from CRIRES+/VLT, offering a more complete picture of rotational dynamics in celestial bodies."

The BKMP will leverage smart contracts to record and verify medicinal plant provenance and fair pricing information, directly addressing the information gap for farmers and creating a transparent, NMPB-recognized supply chain. This platform will also host a user-friendly, gamified educational module on dental patenting, making the process more comprehensible and time-bound for entrepreneurs and students. Concurrently, the AR Identification Tool will utilize deep learning for accurate medicinal plant identification, mitigating misidentification and adulteration concerns, and will be integrated with the BKMP to display verified information and trusted seller ratings, fostering trust among rural consumers with digital platforms. Our methodology will involve collecting data through surveys, interviews with farmers, dentists, and patent officials, and analyzing historical patent data alongside market trends, with qualitative analysis of user feedback to iteratively refine the BKMP and AR tool."

This approach directly addresses the identified gaps by moving beyond mere prediction to understand the *drivers* of temporal variations in prices and arrivals across different agricultural commodities (extending beyond cotton and barley). By incorporating dynamic external factors such as weather patterns, policy changes, global economic indicators, and even sentiment analysis from news and social media, our ST-GNNs can model complex, non-linear interactions and evolving market dynamics. Feature engineering and optimization techniques, like the Whale Optimization Algorithm, will be employed for selecting relevant external factors and network architectures. Furthermore, the methodology will explicitly compare the effectiveness of traditional dissemination approaches with information derived from DMTSC-CI, focusing on delivering actionable quality information and price projections to farmers, thereby fulfilling unmet expectations. The \"broader applications\" gap will be addressed by designing a modular framework adaptable to various commodities and market structures, leveraging the rich datasets from MCX, SEBI, and Indian agricultural markets."
