The unpredictable fatal events called Black Swan events also highly influence the stock market. If the successful stock trends prediction is achieved, then the investors can adopt a more appropriate trading strategy, and that can significantly reduce the risk of investment. In this work, a time-efficient hybrid stock trends prediction framework(HSTPF) is proposed to successfully predict the future trends of the stock market even during the periods of Black Swan events. Here, to improve the prediction accuracy of HSTPF, the Black Swan events analysis and features selection operations are performed, and also the performance of various machine learning classifiers are analyzed. A vast number of experiments are conducted on the two real-world stock market datasets S\\&P BSE SENSEX and Nifty 50, to analyze the performance of the proposed framework. The framework is applied for the single-step and multi-step ahead predictions. The experimental results show that the proposed framework produces over 86\\% of accuracy, and during the Black Swan events, its accuracy is almost 80\\% for single-step ahead predictions. For the multi-step ahead of predictions, the HSTPF is produced satisfactory results. The framework also outperforms other existing similar works even during the Black Swan events in terms of prediction accuracy, and its computational time is also very low.\\par\n\\subsection{A Comprehensive Review of Sentiment Analysis on Indian Regional Languages: Techniques, Challenges, and Trends}\nSentiment\u00a0analysis\u00a0(SA) is the process of understanding\u00a0emotion\u00a0within\u00a0a text. It helps identify the opinion, attitude, and tone of a text categorizing it into positive, negative, or neutral. SA is frequently used today as more and more people get a chance to put out their thoughts due to the advent of social media. Sentiment analysis benefits industries around the globe, like finance, advertising, marketing, travel, hospitality, etc. Although the majority of work done in this field is on global languages like English, in recent years, the importance of SA in local languages has also been widely recognized. This has led to considerable research in the analysis of Indian regional languages. This paper comprehensively reviews SA in the following major Indian Regional languages: Marathi, Hindi, Tamil, Telugu, Malayalam, Bengali, Gujarati, and Urdu. Furthermore, this paper presents techniques, challenges, findings, recent research trends, and future scope for enhancing results accuracy.\\par\n\\subsection{Dental Patents in India: A Decade Long Review}\nBackground: The advent of technology in dentistry compels the safeguard of intellectual property to guarantee a steady flow of ideas. A guarantee preserves the idea/invention which is conductive to the subsequent financial gain or marketing of the said product for the patentee. The main objective of the present study was to illuminate the trends in the dental patents filed in India over the past decade and to analyze these in context with the recent developments in dental markets. Methodology: A total of 641 dental patent applications retrieved from the Indian Government Official Website between 2010 and 2020 were scanned for field of invention, type or status of application along with details regarding date of publication or filing of application, etc., The dataset was collaboratively analyzed using Panda's Library in Python software as analysis tool for data preparation and frequency analysis. The estimates were presented as mean differences and 95\\% confidence intervals. Results: The results showed that Indian Patent Office (IPO) has granted 54 dental patents in the last decade. The maximum applications of the IPO processes are the patent co-operation treaty National Phase applications (53.3\\%), mostly in the bio-engineering field (36.8\\%). Chiefly, patents were filed by individuals and companies (n = 180) and average time for grant was 4.90 years and 5.34 years, respectively. Conclusion: The process of patent application in India although has become digitalized needs to be more comprehensible and time bound, with more awareness disseminated to entrepreneurs and dental students alike.\\par\n\\subsection{The dynamic nexus between futures basis in Indian and global agricultural markets}\nPurpose\nThis study aims to explore the nuances of basis trading, a cornerstone strategy in global agricultural markets and necessitates thoroughly examining the interplay among futures basis values across diverse markets.\n\nDesign/methodology/approach\nFocusing on cotton and barley, the authors use data from 2014 to 2023 to unravel the intricate connections between Indian and international grains markets. The analysis reveals a robust positive correlation in basis values across global markets, indicating the interdependence of these markets over time. The authors observe significant temporal variations in the structures of this interdependence, highlighting the dynamic nature of grain market relationships.\n\nFindings\nInternational cotton consistently emerges as a critical influencer in these dynamics, underscoring its importance in shaping global grain market trends. Given India\u2019s significant role as a grain exporter, the implications of the study extend to the realm of adept risk management in the face of evolving global grain trading landscapes. This study examines the dynamic correlation between the basis trends of cotton and barley in Indian and international markets using the dynamic conditional correlation generalized autoregressive conditional heteroscedasticity model. Key findings reveal a significant positive correlation between similar grain types across regions, alongside notable volatility and occasional negative correlations across different markets.\n\nResearch limitations/implications\nBy understanding the nuances of basis trading and the interplay among basis values, stakeholders can make informed decisions to navigate the complexities of the global grains market and mitigate risks effectively.\n\nOriginality/value\nThis study is one of its kind in exploring the interrelation of emerging economy trading markets with global markets.\n\\par\n\\subsection{Leveraging Deep Learning and Blockchain for Enhanced Transparency and Traceability in the Indian Herbal Product Supply Chain}\nMedicinal plants have been a cornerstone of healthcare practices globally, serving a significant population in developing countries who rely on affordable herbal remedies. However, the current marketing system through Mandis and wholesale markets suffers from opacity. Numerous intermediaries create an information gap for farmers regarding fair pricing and market trends. Additionally, concerns exist about misidentification and adulteration of medicinal plants due to limited knowledge among collectors and traders. The National Medicinal Plants Board (NMPB) recognizes the need for a robust supply chain. This paper proposes a blockchain-based platform \u2018Indian Herbal Blockchain Network (IHBN)\u2019 integrated with Deep Learning for image processing. The deep learning model has achieved a decent accuracy of 90.24\\% which decreases the chance of misidentification. The platform ensures transparent traceability of medicinal plants from source to consumer, along with accurate identification using image analysis. This system promotes transparency within the medicinal plant supply chain, reducing the risk of adulteration and improving overall trust.\\par\n\\subsection{The Impact of Digital Marketing on Rural Indian Markets: A Study on Consumer Behavior and Market Reach}\nAbstract- The study looks into the role of digital marketing in Indian rural areas by analyzing consumers and the limits of market access. Surveys, interviews, and case studies were used by adopting a mixed-methods methodology. According to the findings, rural consumers use smartphones regularly (72\\%), and this group also uses social media each day (68\\%). On top of that, WhatsApp and YouTube appear to be the key platforms among them. Evidence from regression analysis proves that urban exposure to digital ads positively affects people\u2019s purchase habits. While the industry has become bigger, society still deals with challenges such as those involving information technology and trust. The research suggests that having content in different languages and making targeted strategies on key platforms will help engage more people living in rural areas. This research reveals how digital marketing strategies can open up many opportunities for rural India, making it useful for businesses that want to pursue growth in the area.\n\nKeywords- Digital Marketing, Rural India, Consumer Behavior, Market Reach, Social Media, Smartphone Penetration, Digital Advertising.\\par\n\\subsection{Exploring market expansion dilemmas: the case of Aquawhite}\nLearning outcomes\nAfter completion of the case study, the students will be able to understand the complexity of diversification and market expansion strategies in a growing consumer-driven market context, apply strategic frameworks to analyze the Indian oral care market, analyze brand positioning principles to develop a marketing strategy for Aquawhite and evaluate and identify the pros and cons of the various decisions taken during market diversification.\n\nCase overview/synopsis\nThis case study seeks to examine the market expansion dilemmas faced by Aquawhite, a brand in the oral health-care sector, and the role of key decision-makers in addressing these challenges. This case study aims to provide insights into the complexities of brand extension and market expansion strategies in the context of a developing consumer-driven market.

The potential implementation of LLMs in healthcare settings has already garnered considerable attention because of their diverse applications that include facilitating clinical documentation, obtaining insurance pre-authorization, summarizing research papers, or working as a chatbot to answer questions for patients about their specific data and concerns. While offering transformative potential, LLMs warrant a very cautious approach since these models are trained differently from AI-based medical technologies that are regulated already, especially within the critical context of caring for patients. The newest version, GPT-4, that was released in March, 2023, brings the potentials of this technology to support multiple medical tasks; and risks from mishandling results it provides to varying reliability to a new level. Besides being an advanced LLM, it will be able to read texts on images and analyze the context of those images. The regulation of GPT-4 and generative AI in medicine and healthcare without damaging their exciting and transformative potential is a timely and critical challenge to ensure safety, maintain ethical standards, and protect patient privacy. We argue that regulatory oversight should assure medical professionals and patients can use LLMs without causing harm or compromising their data or privacy. This paper summarizes our practical recommendations for what we can expect from regulators to bring this vision to reality.\\par\n\\subsection{Generative AI in healthcare: an implementation science informed translational path on application, integration and governance}\nArtificial intelligence (AI), particularly generative AI, has emerged as a transformative tool in healthcare, with the potential to revolutionize clinical decision-making and improve health outcomes. Generative AI, capable of generating new data such as text and images, holds promise in enhancing patient care, revolutionizing disease diagnosis and expanding treatment options. However, the utility and impact of generative AI in healthcare remain poorly understood, with concerns around ethical and medico-legal implications, integration into healthcare service delivery and workforce utilisation. Also, there is not a clear pathway to implement and integrate generative AI in healthcare delivery. This article aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the use of generative AI in healthcare, focusing on the utility of the technology in healthcare and its translational application highlighting the need for careful planning, execution and management of expectations in adopting generative AI in clinical medicine.

The potential implementation of LLMs in healthcare settings has already garnered considerable attention because of their diverse applications that include facilitating clinical documentation, obtaining insurance pre-authorization, summarizing research papers, or working as a chatbot to answer questions for patients about their specific data and concerns. While offering transformative potential, LLMs warrant a very cautious approach since these models are trained differently from AI-based medical technologies that are regulated already, especially within the critical context of caring for patients. The newest version, GPT-4, that was released in March, 2023, brings the potentials of this technology to support multiple medical tasks; and risks from mishandling results it provides to varying reliability to a new level. Besides being an advanced LLM, it will be able to read texts on images and analyze the context of those images. The regulation of GPT-4 and generative AI in medicine and healthcare without damaging their exciting and transformative potential is a timely and critical challenge to ensure safety, maintain ethical standards, and protect patient privacy. We argue that regulatory oversight should assure medical professionals and patients can use LLMs without causing harm or compromising their data or privacy. This paper summarizes our practical recommendations for what we can expect from regulators to bring this vision to reality.\n\n\n### Generative AI in healthcare: an implementation science informed translational path on application, integration and governance\n\nArtificial intelligence (AI), particularly generative AI, has emerged as a transformative tool in healthcare, with the potential to revolutionize clinical decision-making and improve health outcomes. Generative AI, capable of generating new data such as text and images, holds promise in enhancing patient care, revolutionizing disease diagnosis and expanding treatment options. However, the utility and impact of generative AI in healthcare remain poorly understood, with concerns around ethical and medico-legal implications, integration into healthcare service delivery and workforce utilisation. Also, there is not a clear pathway to implement and integrate generative AI in healthcare delivery. This article aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the use of generative AI in healthcare, focusing on the utility of the technology in healthcare and its translational application highlighting the need for careful planning, execution and management of expectations in adopting generative AI in clinical medicine. Key considerations include factors such as data privacy, security and the irreplaceable role of clinicians\u2019 expertise. Frameworks like the technology acceptance model (TAM) and the Non-Adoption, Abandonment, Scale-up, Spread and Sustainability (NASSS) model are considered to promote responsible integration. These frameworks allow anticipating and proactively addressing barriers to adoption, facilitating stakeholder participation and responsibly transitioning care systems to harness generative AI\u2019s potential. Generative AI has the potential to transform healthcare through automated systems, enhanced clinical decision-making and democratization of expertise with diagnostic support tools providing timely, personalized suggestions. Generative AI applications across billing, diagnosis, treatment and research can also make healthcare delivery more efficient, equitable and effective. However, integration of generative AI necessitates meticulous change management and risk mitigation strategies. Technological capabilities alone cannot shift complex care ecosystems overnight; rather, structured adoption programs grounded in implementation science are imperative. It is strongly argued in this article that generative AI can usher in tremendous healthcare progress, if introduced responsibly. Strategic adoption based on implementation science, incremental deployment and balanced messaging around opportunities versus limitations helps promote safe, ethical generative AI integration. Extensive real-world piloting and iteration aligned to clinical priorities should drive development. With conscientious governance centred on human wellbeing over technological novelty, generative AI can enhance accessibility, affordability and quality of care. As these models continue advancing rapidly, ongoing reassessment and transparent communication around their strengths and weaknesses remain vital to restoring trust, realizing positive potential and, most importantly, improving patient outcomes.\n\n\n### Mapping the regulatory landscape of AI in healthcare in Africa\n\nIntroduction: Artificial intelligence (AI)-enhanced technology has seen unprecedented expansion in the recent past. This growth brings with it huge opportunities for the positive transformation of the economy, business, healthcare, and society. However, a critical question is whether, and to what extent, regulatory measures and mechanisms have been implemented to safeguard its design, development, and deployment. This paper offers a scoping exercise that maps the regulatory landscape of AI in healthcare (including health research) in certain African countries. Methods: This research is conducted across 12 African countries: Botswana, Cameroon, The Gambia, Ghana, Kenya, Malawi, Nigeria, Rwanda, South Africa, Tanzania, Uganda, and Zimbabwe. As limited specific AI legislation is found in these African countries, and because AI is informed by ancillary regulatory frameworks, we include data protection, digital health, consumer protection, and intellectual property in our research.

However, hospitals may not be well equipped to handle safe and effective development and/or procurement of AI systems. Furthermore, upcoming regulations such as the EU AI Act may enforce the need to establish new management systems, quality assurance and control mechanisms, novel to healthcare organizations. This paper discusses challenges in AI implementation, particularly potential gaps in current management systems (MS), by reviewing the harmonized standard for AI MS, ISO 42001, as part of a gap analysis of a tertiary acute hospital with ongoing AI activities. Examination of the industry agnostic ISO 42001 reveals a technical debt within healthcare, aligning with previous research on digitalization and AI implementation. To successfully implement AI with quality assurance in mind, emphasis should be put on the foundation and structure of the healthcare organizations, including both workforce and data infrastructure.\n\n\n### Medical Doctors\u2019 Perceptions of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in Healthcare\n\nIntroduction With the current exponential expansion of robotics, implants, and imaging technologies, diagnostic processes within the healthcare industry are becoming popular platforms for artificial intelligence (AI) use. Thus, an understanding of physicians\u2019 attitudes toward AI and the extent to which medical educators are ready to work with AI is necessary. This research aimed to study doctors\u2019 perceptions of AI in healthcare. Methods A web-based questionnaire organized into four sections, namely, demographics, concepts of AI, education in AI, and implementation challenges related to AI, was designed systematically based on a literature search and circulated among medical doctors from various fields. Results Study participants exhibited a lower score toward familiarity with AI. Only 52.12% (74/142) of physicians completed the survey. The greatest challenge associated with the use of AI in therapeutic settings was found to be the degree of autonomy, with a score of 3.56. Among the participants, 67.61% felt that the lack of human supervision was the most important limiting factor in the implementation of AI in clinical practice. However, the participants demonstrated a strong interest in understanding the concepts of AI in the near future. Conclusion This study revealed a low degree of familiarity with AI, highlighting the need for medical schools and hospitals to establish specialized education and training programs for physicians to improve patient outcomes.\n\n\n### AI in Healthcare Supply Chain Management: Enhancing Efficiency and Reducing Costs with Predictive Analytics\n\nThis paper explores the transformative role of artificial intelligence (AI) and predictive analytics in enhancing operational efficiency within healthcare supply chains.

Initial results from AI applications in healthcare show promise but are rarely translated into clinical practice successfully and ethically. This occurs despite an abundance of \u201cTrustworthy AI\u201d guidelines. How can we explain the translational gaps of AI in healthcare? This paper offers a fresh perspective on this problem, showing that failing translation of healthcare AI markedly arises from a lack of an operational definition of \u201ctrust\u201d and \u201ctrustworthiness\u201d. This leads to (a) unintentional misuse concerning what trust (worthiness) is and (b) the risk of intentional abuse by industry stakeholders engaging in ethics washing. By pointing out these issues, we aim to highlight the obstacles that hinder translation of Trustworthy medical AI to practice and prevent it from fulfilling its unmet promises.\n\n\n## References\n\n- B.

The potential implementation of LLMs in healthcare settings has already garnered considerable attention because of their diverse applications that include facilitating clinical documentation, obtaining insurance pre-authorization, summarizing research papers, or working as a chatbot to answer questions for patients about their specific data and concerns. While offering transformative potential, LLMs warrant a very cautious approach since these models are trained differently from AI-based medical technologies that are regulated already, especially within the critical context of caring for patients. The newest version, GPT-4, that was released in March, 2023, brings the potentials of this technology to support multiple medical tasks; and risks from mishandling results it provides to varying reliability to a new level. Besides being an advanced LLM, it will be able to read texts on images and analyze the context of those images. The regulation of GPT-4 and generative AI in medicine and healthcare without damaging their exciting and transformative potential is a timely and critical challenge to ensure safety, maintain ethical standards, and protect patient privacy. We argue that regulatory oversight should assure medical professionals and patients can use LLMs without causing harm or compromising their data or privacy. This paper summarizes our practical recommendations for what we can expect from regulators to bring this vision to reality.\n\n\n### Generative AI in healthcare: an implementation science informed translational path on application, integration and governance\n\nArtificial intelligence (AI), particularly generative AI, has emerged as a transformative tool in healthcare, with the potential to revolutionize clinical decision-making and improve health outcomes.

However, the utility and impact of generative AI in healthcare remain poorly understood, with concerns around ethical and medico-legal implications, integration into healthcare service delivery and workforce utilisation. Also, there is not a clear pathway to implement and integrate generative AI in healthcare delivery. This article aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the use of generative AI in healthcare, focusing on the utility of the technology in healthcare and its translational application highlighting the need for careful planning, execution and management of expectations in adopting generative AI in clinical medicine. Key considerations include factors such as data privacy, security and the irreplaceable role of clinicians\u2019 expertise. Frameworks like the technology acceptance model (TAM) and the Non-Adoption, Abandonment, Scale-up, Spread and Sustainability (NASSS) model are considered to promote responsible integration. These frameworks allow anticipating and proactively addressing barriers to adoption, facilitating stakeholder participation and responsibly transitioning care systems to harness generative AI\u2019s potential. Generative AI has the potential to transform healthcare through automated systems, enhanced clinical decision-making and democratization of expertise with diagnostic support tools providing timely, personalized suggestions. Generative AI applications across billing, diagnosis, treatment and research can also make healthcare delivery more efficient, equitable and effective. However, integration of generative AI necessitates meticulous change management and risk mitigation strategies. Technological capabilities alone cannot shift complex care ecosystems overnight; rather, structured adoption programs grounded in implementation science are imperative. It is strongly argued in this article that generative AI can usher in tremendous healthcare progress, if introduced responsibly. Strategic adoption based on implementation science, incremental deployment and balanced messaging around opportunities versus limitations helps promote safe, ethical generative AI integration. Extensive real-world piloting and iteration aligned to clinical priorities should drive development. With conscientious governance centred on human wellbeing over technological novelty, generative AI can enhance accessibility, affordability and quality of care. As these models continue advancing rapidly, ongoing reassessment and transparent communication around their strengths and weaknesses remain vital to restoring trust, realizing positive potential and, most importantly, improving patient outcomes.\n\n\n### Mapping the regulatory landscape of AI in healthcare in Africa\n\nIntroduction: Artificial intelligence (AI)-enhanced technology has seen unprecedented expansion in the recent past.

Initial results from AI applications in healthcare show promise but are rarely translated into clinical practice successfully and ethically. This occurs despite an abundance of \u201cTrustworthy AI\u201d guidelines. How can we explain the translational gaps of AI in healthcare? This paper offers a fresh perspective on this problem, showing that failing translation of healthcare AI markedly arises from a lack of an operational definition of \u201ctrust\u201d and \u201ctrustworthiness\u201d. This leads to (a) unintentional misuse concerning what trust (worthiness) is and (b) the risk of intentional abuse by industry stakeholders engaging in ethics washing. By pointing out these issues, we aim to highlight the obstacles that hinder translation of Trustworthy medical AI to practice and prevent it from fulfilling its unmet promises.\n\n\n## References\n\n- B.

The potential implementation of LLMs in healthcare settings has already garnered considerable attention because of their diverse applications that include facilitating clinical documentation, obtaining insurance pre-authorization, summarizing research papers, or working as a chatbot to answer questions for patients about their specific data and concerns. While offering transformative potential, LLMs warrant a very cautious approach since these models are trained differently from AI-based medical technologies that are regulated already, especially within the critical context of caring for patients. The newest version, GPT-4, that was released in March, 2023, brings the potentials of this technology to support multiple medical tasks; and risks from mishandling results it provides to varying reliability to a new level. Besides being an advanced LLM, it will be able to read texts on images and analyze the context of those images. The regulation of GPT-4 and generative AI in medicine and healthcare without damaging their exciting and transformative potential is a timely and critical challenge to ensure safety, maintain ethical standards, and protect patient privacy. We argue that regulatory oversight should assure medical professionals and patients can use LLMs without causing harm or compromising their data or privacy. This paper summarizes our practical recommendations for what we can expect from regulators to bring this vision to reality.\n\n\n### Generative AI in healthcare: an implementation science informed translational path on application, integration and governance\n\nArtificial intelligence (AI), particularly generative AI, has emerged as a transformative tool in healthcare, with the potential to revolutionize clinical decision-making and improve health outcomes. Generative AI, capable of generating new data such as text and images, holds promise in enhancing patient care, revolutionizing disease diagnosis and expanding treatment options. However, the utility and impact of generative AI in healthcare remain poorly understood, with concerns around ethical and medico-legal implications, integration into healthcare service delivery and workforce utilisation. Also, there is not a clear pathway to implement and integrate generative AI in healthcare delivery. This article aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the use of generative AI in healthcare, focusing on the utility of the technology in healthcare and its translational application highlighting the need for careful planning, execution and management of expectations in adopting generative AI in clinical medicine. Key considerations include factors such as data privacy, security and the irreplaceable role of clinicians\u2019 expertise. Frameworks like the technology acceptance model (TAM) and the Non-Adoption, Abandonment, Scale-up, Spread and Sustainability (NASSS) model are considered to promote responsible integration. These frameworks allow anticipating and proactively addressing barriers to adoption, facilitating stakeholder participation and responsibly transitioning care systems to harness generative AI\u2019s potential. Generative AI has the potential to transform healthcare through automated systems, enhanced clinical decision-making and democratization of expertise with diagnostic support tools providing timely, personalized suggestions. Generative AI applications across billing, diagnosis, treatment and research can also make healthcare delivery more efficient, equitable and effective. However, integration of generative AI necessitates meticulous change management and risk mitigation strategies. Technological capabilities alone cannot shift complex care ecosystems overnight; rather, structured adoption programs grounded in implementation science are imperative. It is strongly argued in this article that generative AI can usher in tremendous healthcare progress, if introduced responsibly. Strategic adoption based on implementation science, incremental deployment and balanced messaging around opportunities versus limitations helps promote safe, ethical generative AI integration. Extensive real-world piloting and iteration aligned to clinical priorities should drive development. With conscientious governance centred on human wellbeing over technological novelty, generative AI can enhance accessibility, affordability and quality of care. As these models continue advancing rapidly, ongoing reassessment and transparent communication around their strengths and weaknesses remain vital to restoring trust, realizing positive potential and, most importantly, improving patient outcomes.\n\n\n### Mapping the regulatory landscape of AI in healthcare in Africa\n\nIntroduction: Artificial intelligence (AI)-enhanced technology has seen unprecedented expansion in the recent past. This growth brings with it huge opportunities for the positive transformation of the economy, business, healthcare, and society. However, a critical question is whether, and to what extent, regulatory measures and mechanisms have been implemented to safeguard its design, development, and deployment. This paper offers a scoping exercise that maps the regulatory landscape of AI in healthcare (including health research) in certain African countries. Methods: This research is conducted across 12 African countries: Botswana, Cameroon, The Gambia, Ghana, Kenya, Malawi, Nigeria, Rwanda, South Africa, Tanzania, Uganda, and Zimbabwe. As limited specific AI legislation is found in these African countries, and because AI is informed by ancillary regulatory frameworks, we include data protection, digital health, consumer protection, and intellectual property in our research. A scoping review method was applied with a manual search of digital libraries with search terms customised for each repository consisting of core search terms for the various topics, including, among others, \u201claw,\u201d \u201cregulation,\u201d \u201cartificial intelligence,\u201d \u201cdata protection,\u201d \u201cintellectual property,\u201d and \u201cdigital health\u201d. Results and discussion: Analysis of the data demonstrated that while in the African countries under investigation there is no sui generis AI regulation, recent developments were found in areas that inform AI adoption, including in digital health, data protection, consumer protection, and intellectual property. Our findings highlight the fragmentation of the African AI regulatory landscape and illustrate the importance of continued AI regulatory development to ensure that Africa is well positioned for future AI adoption in health.\n\n\n### AI in Healthcare: Revolutionizing Diagnosis and Therapy\n\nArtificial Intelligence (AI) is revolutionizing healthcare through its integration into various domains, significantly enhancing the efficiency, accuracy, and effectiveness of medical practices. This review explores the transformative impact of AI across multiple aspects of healthcare, including diagnostics, personalized treatment, drug discovery, surgery, and more.

These include advancements in natural language processing, AI-enhanced telemedicine, wearable health technologies, and ethical AI governance. As AI technology continues to evolve, its impact on healthcare will become increasingly significant, driving progress in patient care, operational efficiency, and medical research. Collaborative efforts among technologists, clinicians, researchers, and policymakers will be essential in harnessing AI's full potential while addressing the complexities and ethical challenges associated with its use. This review underscores the promise of AI to revolutionize healthcare and improve patient outcomes while emphasizing the need for responsible implementation and ongoing evaluation.\n\n\n### Challenges and Opportunities for AI in Healthcare\n\nThe integration of artificial intelligence (AI) in healthcare presents a dual challenge: maximizing the efficiency of medical processes while safeguarding patient privacy. This comprehensive review examines the delicate balance between leveraging AI's potential in healthcare and preserving individual data privacy. Through analysis of recent literature, case studies, and regulatory frameworks, we explore the current landscape of AI applications in healthcare, associated privacy risks, and emerging solutions. Findings reveal that while AI significantly enhances diagnostic accuracy and treatment planning, it also raises concerns about data security and patient confidentiality. Key challenges include ensuring GDPR and HIPAA compliance, managing large-scale health data, and maintaining transparency in AI decision-making processes. Promising approaches such as federated learning and differential privacy emerge as potential solutions. This review underscores the need for a multidisciplinary approach involving healthcare providers, AI developers, ethicists, and policymakers to create robust, privacy-preserving AI systems in healthcare.\n\n\n### Managing Risk and Quality of AI in Healthcare: Are Hospitals Ready for Implementation?\n\nAbstract Artificial intelligence (AI) provides a unique opportunity to help meet the demands of the future healthcare system. However, hospitals may not be well equipped to handle safe and effective development and/or procurement of AI systems. Furthermore, upcoming regulations such as the EU AI Act may enforce the need to establish new management systems, quality assurance and control mechanisms, novel to healthcare organizations. This paper discusses challenges in AI implementation, particularly potential gaps in current management systems (MS), by reviewing the harmonized standard for AI MS, ISO 42001, as part of a gap analysis of a tertiary acute hospital with ongoing AI activities. Examination of the industry agnostic ISO 42001 reveals a technical debt within healthcare, aligning with previous research on digitalization and AI implementation.

Initial results from AI applications in healthcare show promise but are rarely translated into clinical practice successfully and ethically. This occurs despite an abundance of \u201cTrustworthy AI\u201d guidelines. How can we explain the translational gaps of AI in healthcare? This paper offers a fresh perspective on this problem, showing that failing translation of healthcare AI markedly arises from a lack of an operational definition of \u201ctrust\u201d and \u201ctrustworthiness\u201d. This leads to (a) unintentional misuse concerning what trust (worthiness) is and (b) the risk of intentional abuse by industry stakeholders engaging in ethics washing. By pointing out these issues, we aim to highlight the obstacles that hinder translation of Trustworthy medical AI to practice and prevent it from fulfilling its unmet promises.\n\n\n## References\n\n- B.

    "topic": "Rewetting study on nuclear fuel bundle",
    "markdown": "# Rewetting study on nuclear fuel bundle\n\n---\n\n## Abstract\n\nAccurate characterization of thermal-hydraulic phenomena within nuclear fuel assemblies is paramount for ensuring reactor safety and optimizing operational efficiency. This review synthesizes recent advancements in experimental and computational approaches employed to investigate complex flow and heat transfer behaviors within these geometries. Studies encompassing steady-state and accident scenarios, such as Loss of Coolant Accidents (LOCA), highlight the critical role of radiative heat transfer, particularly in pressurized heavy water reactor (PHWR) fuel bundles, where significant radial temperature gradients are observed. Furthermore, investigations into coolant flow dynamics, employing methods ranging from detailed aerodynamic modeling based on hydrodynamic similarity to advanced Magnetic Resonance Velocimetry (MRV), provide essential data for validating computational fluid dynamics (CFD) models. The application of advanced turbulence modeling techniques, such as the Partially Averaged Navier-Stokes (PANS) method, demonstrates promise in bridging the gap between Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) and Direct Numerical Simulation (DNS) for capturing intricate flow physics around spacer grids. These diverse research efforts underscore a persistent need for high-fidelity experimental datasets and refined computational tools to support the design, safety analysis, and performance optimization of modern nuclear reactor cores, particularly in emerging designs like small modular reactors (SMRs). The integration of these findings is crucial for advancing the understanding of fuel rod behavior under various operational conditions, including extreme accident scenarios involving fuel melting and molten material migration.\n\n\n## Introduction\n\nThe design and safe operation of nuclear reactors are intrinsically linked to a profound understanding of the thermal-hydraulic conditions within the fuel assemblies. These core components are responsible for efficient heat generation and transfer, making the precise characterization of fluid flow and heat transport critical. Deviations from nominal conditions, whether due to operational transients or severe accident scenarios like a Loss of Coolant Accident (LOCA), can lead to significant thermal stresses and potentially compromise fuel integrity. Consequently, robust predictive capabilities are required to simulate and analyze these phenomena. This necessitates the development and validation of sophisticated experimental techniques and computational methodologies that can accurately represent the complex, multi-physics interactions occurring within densely packed fuel rod bundles. The pursuit of enhanced safety margins, improved fuel utilization, and the development of next-generation reactor concepts, such as Small Modular Reactors (SMRs), further amplifies the demand for detailed and reliable data on fuel assembly behavior under a wide spectrum of operating conditions and potential off-normal events.\n\n\n## Literature Review\n\nResearch into the thermal-hydraulic behavior of nuclear fuel assemblies has seen significant contributions from both experimental and computational investigations. Studies have focused on characterizing heat transfer mechanisms, particularly radiative heat transfer, within fuel bundles during accident scenarios. For instance, analysis of a 37-pin PHWR fuel bundle under simulated LOCA conditions coupled with ECCS failure revealed significant radial temperature gradients, a finding supported by experimental, numerical, and analytical methods such as the radiosity network method.  Regarding flow dynamics, investigations have employed a range of techniques to capture intricate flow patterns. Aerodynamic modeling based on hydrodynamic similarity has been utilized to study coolant flow in fuel rod bundles for SMRs, providing insights into axial and cross-flows and generating data for CFD model validation.  Advanced velocimetry techniques, such as Magnetic Resonance Velocimetry (MRV), have been developed to provide volumetric measurements of mean velocity vectors and Reynolds stress tensors in fuel assembly models with mixing grids, achieving high accuracy and offering valuable validation data for CFD.  Furthermore, experimental studies on specific reactor designs, such as the RITM reactor fuel assembly, have utilized pneumometric methods and visualization techniques to map axial and tangential velocities, contributing to design substantiation and CFD validation.  In the realm of computational fluid dynamics, advanced turbulence modeling approaches are being explored. The Partially Averaged Navier-Stokes (PANS) method, which effectively bridges RANS and LES, has shown promise in simulating flow through fuel bundles with spacer grids, demonstrating its capability to capture key flow physics when configured appropriately.  Beyond standard operational conditions, research has also delved into severe accident phenomena. The Moving Particle Semi-Implicit (MPS) method has been employed to numerically investigate fuel rod melting and molten material migration, incorporating models for heat transfer, eutectic reactions, and surface tension to simulate complex phase transitions and material movement with validation against experimental data and analytical solutions.\n\n\n## Research Gaps\n\nDespite considerable progress, several critical research gaps remain in the comprehensive understanding and simulation of nuclear fuel assembly behavior. A persistent need exists for the refinement of thermohydraulic calculation methods, particularly those employing a cell-by-cell approximation for reactor cores, to enhance predictive accuracy. This is closely related to the broader requirement for improved methods for thermal-hydraulic calculations of nuclear reactor cores in general.  Furthermore, there is a recognized lack of experimental data specifically tailored for validating CFD programs in the context of SMR fuel rod bundles, hindering the reliable deployment of these advanced designs.  Beyond standard operational concerns, a significant gap lies in the comprehensive understanding of fuel rod behavior during severe accidents. This includes detailed insights into fuel melting, molten material migration, and their subsequent impact on core integrity, phenomena that are inherently complex and necessitate sophisticated simulation capabilities.  The validation of specific CFD programs, such as LOGOS, also remains an area requiring dedicated effort.  Ultimately, the justification and optimization of fuel assembly designs are fundamentally dependent on detailed flow characteristics, highlighting the need for continued generation of such data, particularly from advanced measurement techniques.\n\n\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe reviewed literature underscores the ongoing evolution of experimental and computational methodologies for characterizing thermal-hydraulic phenomena within nuclear fuel assemblies. Significant advancements have been made in obtaining detailed flow and heat transfer data, ranging from radiative heat transfer in accident scenarios to intricate coolant flow patterns in operational configurations. The development and application of advanced techniques, such as MRV for flow field measurements and PANS for turbulence modeling, demonstrate a commitment to enhancing predictive capabilities. However, persistent research gaps necessitate further investigation. Future research should prioritize the generation of comprehensive, high-fidelity experimental datasets for advanced reactor designs, particularly SMRs, to rigorously validate CFD models. Continued development and refinement of thermohydraulic calculation methods, including those that account for complex phenomena like fuel melting and molten material migration, are essential. Focused efforts on validating specific CFD codes with these benchmark datasets will be crucial. Ultimately, addressing these gaps will contribute to enhanced reactor safety, improved operational efficiency, and the successful deployment of next-generation nuclear energy systems.\n\n\n## References\n\n- K.

The study employs experimental, numerical (ANSYS Fluent 19.0), and analytical (radiosity network method) techniques, finding good agreement between them. Results indicate a radial temperature gradient in the fuel bundle simulator (FBS) and insignificant circumferential temperature gradients in the FBS, Pressure Tube (PT), and Calandria Tube (CT).\\par\n\n\\subsection{Scale-resolving simulations of the flow in a nuclear fuel bundle with a channel spacer grid using partially averaged Navier\u2013Stokes and large-eddy simulation}\nThis paper evaluates the Partially Averaged Navier\u2013Stokes (PANS) method for simulating flow in a nuclear fuel bundle with a spacer grid. The PANS model's ability to bridge between RANS and DNS is investigated by varying filter cutoff parameters.

This section provides an overview of the problem domain and summarizes the key prior works analyzed by the AI Summarizer Agent.\\par\n\n\\subsection{Scaling Rectified Flow Transformers for High-Resolution Image Synthesis}\nThis paper enhances rectified flow models for high-resolution image synthesis by biasing noise sampling towards perceptually relevant scales. They introduce a novel transformer architecture for text-to-image generation that separates modalities and allows bidirectional information flow, leading to improved text comprehension and overall synthesis quality, outperforming state-of-the-art models.\\par\n\n\\subsection{iTransformer: Inverted Transformers Are Effective for Time Series Forecasting}\niTransformer proposes a novel approach to time series forecasting by repurposing the Transformer architecture. Instead of the standard tokenization, it inverts the Transformer's attention and feed-forward networks to operate on temporal points rather than variates, enabling better modeling of variate-centric dependencies and improved performance with larger lookback windows. This architecture achieves state-of-the-art results on real-world datasets, offering enhanced performance and generalization for time series forecasting.\\par\n\n\\subsection{Transformers are SSMs: Generalized Models and Efficient Algorithms Through Structured State Space Duality}\nThis paper establishes a theoretical connection between Transformers and State Space Models (SSMs) through a State Space Duality (SSD) framework, revealing their underlying structural similarities via structured semiseparable matrices. Leveraging this duality, the authors introduce Mamba-2, a new architecture with an enhanced SSM core that achieves significantly faster inference speeds while maintaining competitive performance with Transformers on language modeling tasks.\\par\n\n\\subsection{Unified Training of Universal Time Series Forecasting Transformers}\nThis paper introduces Moirai, a Masked Encoder-based Universal Time Series Forecasting Transformer designed to overcome the limitations of traditional one-model-per-dataset approaches in deep learning for time series forecasting. Moirai addresses challenges like cross-frequency learning, arbitrary variate numbers, and varying data distributions by enhancing the Transformer architecture and is trained on the extensive LOTSA dataset.  It demonstrates competitive or superior zero-shot forecasting performance compared to full-shot models.\\par\n\n\\subsection{Representation Alignment for Generation: Training Diffusion Transformers Is Easier Than You Think}\nThis paper proposes REPresentation Alignment (REPA), a novel regularization technique to improve the training efficiency and generation quality of diffusion models. REPA aligns the hidden states of noisy inputs within the diffusion network with representations from external, pre-trained visual encoders. This approach significantly speeds up training and enhances sample generation for diffusion and flow-based transformers like DiTs and SiTs.\\par\n\n\\subsection{Chain of Thought Empowers Transformers to Solve Inherently Serial Problems}\nError processing: Chain of Thought Empowers Transformers to Solve Inherently Serial Problems\\par\n\n\\subsection{BEVFormer: Learning Bird\u2019s-Eye-View Representation From LiDAR-Camera via Spatiotemporal Transformers}\nBEVFormer is a novel framework that learns unified Bird's-Eye-View (BEV) representations from LiDAR and camera data using spatiotemporal transformers. It effectively fuses multi-modal information by employing spatial cross-attention for current scene feature extraction and temporal self-attention for integrating historical BEV information, achieving state-of-the-art performance on various autonomous driving perception tasks.\\par\n\n\\subsection{SANA: Efficient High-Resolution Image Synthesis with Linear Diffusion Transformers}\nSana is a text-to-image generation framework designed for efficient high-resolution (up to 4096x4096) image synthesis. It achieves remarkable speed and quality on consumer hardware through innovations in deep compression autoencoders, linear diffusion transformers, decoder-only text encoders with in-context learning, and efficient training/sampling techniques like Flow-DPM-Solver.\\par\n\n\\subsection{Repeat After Me: Transformers are Better than State Space Models at Copying}\nThis paper theoretically and empirically demonstrates that Transformers significantly outperform Generalized State Space Models (GSSMs) on tasks requiring copying from input context. While GSSMs are efficient at inference, their fixed-size latent state fundamentally limits their ability to copy long sequences, whereas Transformers can handle exponentially long strings. This suggests a fundamental gap in performance for context-dependent tasks.\\par\n\n\\subsection{Convolutions are competitive with transformers for protein sequence pretraining}\nThis research investigates the effectiveness of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) compared to Transformers for protein sequence pretraining. The study demonstrates that CNN-based models can achieve competitive or even superior performance to Transformers across various downstream tasks while offering linear scalability with sequence length, overcoming the quadratic limitations of Transformers. This suggests that CNNs are a viable and computationally efficient alternative for protein language modeling, especially for longer sequences.\\par\n\n\\section{LITERATURE SURVEY}\nThis section

Abstract\n\nThis paper presents a structured synthesis of prior research on the topic, identifies critical research gaps, and proposes an experiment to advance understanding and improve Thermal Protection System (TPS) performance.\n\n## 2. Introduction\n\nThis section presents an overview of the research papers relevant to the topic.\n\n### 2.1 Scaling Rectified Flow Transformers for High-Resolution Image Synthesis\n\nThis paper enhances rectified flow models for high-resolution image synthesis by biasing noise sampling towards perceptually relevant scales. They introduce a novel transformer architecture for text-to-image generation that separates modalities and allows bidirectional information flow, leading to improved text comprehension and overall synthesis quality, outperforming state-of-the-art models.\n\n\n### 2.2 iTransformer: Inverted Transformers Are Effective for Time Series Forecasting\n\niTransformer proposes a novel approach to time series forecasting by repurposing the Transformer architecture. Instead of the standard tokenization, it inverts the Transformer's attention and feed-forward networks to operate on temporal points rather than variates, enabling better modeling of variate-centric dependencies and improved performance with larger lookback windows. This architecture achieves state-of-the-art results on real-world datasets, offering enhanced performance and generalization for time series forecasting.\n\n\n### 2.3 Transformers are SSMs: Generalized Models and Efficient Algorithms Through Structured State Space Duality\n\nThis paper establishes a theoretical connection between Transformers and State Space Models (SSMs) through a State Space Duality (SSD) framework, revealing their underlying structural similarities via structured semiseparable matrices. Leveraging this duality, the authors introduce Mamba-2, a new architecture with an enhanced SSM core that achieves significantly faster inference speeds while maintaining competitive performance with Transformers on language modeling tasks.\n\n\n### 2.4 Unified Training of Universal Time Series Forecasting Transformers\n\nThis paper introduces Moirai, a Masked Encoder-based Universal Time Series Forecasting Transformer designed to overcome the limitations of traditional one-model-per-dataset approaches in deep learning for time series forecasting. Moirai addresses challenges like cross-frequency learning, arbitrary variate numbers, and varying data distributions by enhancing the Transformer architecture and is trained on the extensive LOTSA dataset.  It demonstrates competitive or superior zero-shot forecasting performance compared to full-shot models.\n\n\n### 2.5 Representation Alignment for Generation: Training Diffusion Transformers Is Easier Than You Think\n\nThis paper proposes REPresentation Alignment (REPA), a novel regularization technique to improve the training efficiency and generation quality of diffusion models. REPA aligns the hidden states of noisy inputs within the diffusion network with representations from external, pre-trained visual encoders. This approach significantly speeds up training and enhances sample generation for diffusion and flow-based transformers like DiTs and SiTs.\n\n\n### 2.6 Chain of Thought Empowers Transformers to Solve Inherently Serial Problems\n\nError processing: Chain of Thought Empowers Transformers to Solve Inherently Serial Problems\n\n\n### 2.7 BEVFormer: Learning Bird\u2019s-Eye-View Representation From LiDAR-Camera via Spatiotemporal Transformers\n\nBEVFormer is a novel framework that learns unified Bird's-Eye-View (BEV) representations from LiDAR and camera data using spatiotemporal transformers. It effectively fuses multi-modal information by employing spatial cross-attention for current scene feature extraction and temporal self-attention for integrating historical BEV information, achieving state-of-the-art performance on various autonomous driving perception tasks.\n\n\n### 2.8 SANA: Efficient High-Resolution Image Synthesis with Linear Diffusion Transformers\n\nSana is a text-to-image generation framework designed for efficient high-resolution (up to 4096x4096) image synthesis. It achieves remarkable speed and quality on consumer hardware through innovations in deep compression autoencoders, linear diffusion transformers, decoder-only text encoders with in-context learning, and efficient training/sampling techniques like Flow-DPM-Solver.\n\n\n### 2.9 Repeat After Me: Transformers are Better than State Space Models at Copying\n\nThis paper theoretically and empirically demonstrates that Transformers significantly outperform Generalized State Space Models (GSSMs) on tasks requiring copying from input context. While GSSMs are efficient at inference, their fixed-size latent state fundamentally limits their ability to copy long sequences, whereas Transformers can handle exponentially long strings. This suggests a fundamental gap in performance for context-dependent tasks.\n\n\n### 2.10 Convolutions are competitive with transformers for protein sequence pretraining\n\nThis research investigates the effectiveness of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) compared to Transformers for protein sequence pretraining. The study demonstrates that CNN-based models can achieve competitive or even superior performance to Transformers across various downstream tasks while offering linear scalability with sequence length, overcoming the quadratic limitations of Transformers. This suggests that CNNs are a viable and computationally efficient alternative for protein language modeling, especially for longer sequences.\n\n\n## 3.

Abstract\n\nThis paper presents a structured synthesis of prior research on the topic, identifies critical research gaps, and proposes an experiment to advance understanding and improve Thermal Protection System (TPS) performance.\n\n## 2. Introduction\n\nThis section presents an overview of the research papers relevant to the topic.\n\n### 2.1 Scaling Rectified Flow Transformers for High-Resolution Image Synthesis\n\nThis paper presents a novel approach to high-resolution image synthesis using rectified flow transformers. The authors introduce an improved noise sampling technique that biases training towards perceptually relevant scales and a transformer architecture with modality-specific weights and bidirectional information flow for enhanced text-to-image generation. Their largest models demonstrate state-of-the-art performance.\n\n\n### 2.2 iTransformer: Inverted Transformers Are Effective for Time Series Forecasting\n\niTransformer reconfigures the Transformer architecture for time series forecasting by inverting the dimensions, applying attention to individual time points to capture multivariate correlations, and using the feed-forward network for each variate to learn nonlinear representations. This approach achieves state-of-the-art results, demonstrating improved performance, generalization, and efficient utilization of lookback windows, positioning it as a robust backbone for forecasting.\n\n\n### 2.3 Transformers are SSMs: Generalized Models and Efficient Algorithms Through Structured State Space Duality\n\nThis paper establishes a theoretical connection between Transformers and State-Space Models (SSMs) through a \"state space duality\" (SSD) framework, which unifies these architectures via structured semiseparable matrices. This framework leads to the development of Mamba-2, a new architecture that refines Mamba's selective SSM, achieving significant speedups (2-8X) while maintaining competitive performance with Transformers on language modeling tasks.\n\n\n### 2.4 Unified Training of Universal Time Series Forecasting Transformers\n\nThis paper introduces Moirai, a Masked Encoder-based Universal Time Series Forecasting Transformer, designed to overcome challenges in universal time series forecasting like cross-frequency learning, arbitrary variates, and distributional variations. Trained on the large-scale LOTSA dataset, Moirai demonstrates competitive or superior zero-shot forecasting performance compared to full-shot models.\n\n\n### 2.5 Representation Alignment for Generation: Training Diffusion Transformers Is Easier Than You Think\n\nThis paper proposes REPresentation Alignment (REPA), a simple regularization technique to improve diffusion model training by aligning noisy hidden states with external, pre-trained visual representations. This method significantly enhances training efficiency and generation quality for diffusion and flow-based transformers like DiTs and SiTs, achieving faster training times and state-of-the-art FID scores.\n\n\n### 2.6 Chain of Thought Empowers Transformers to Solve Inherently Serial Problems\n\nError processing: Chain of Thought Empowers Transformers to Solve Inherently Serial Problems\n\n\n### 2.7 BEVFormer: Learning Bird\u2019s-Eye-View Representation From LiDAR-Camera via Spatiotemporal Transformers\n\nBEVFormer is a novel framework that learns unified Bird's-Eye-View (BEV) representations from LiDAR and camera data using spatiotemporal transformers. It leverages spatial cross-attention for multi-modality fusion and temporal self-attention for historical BEV information aggregation. This approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on 3D perception tasks and extends to object tracking, vectorized mapping, occupancy prediction, and end-to-end autonomous driving.\n\n\n### 2.8 SANA: Efficient High-Resolution Image Synthesis with Linear Diffusion Transformers\n\nSANA is a text-to-image framework designed for efficient high-resolution image synthesis (up to 4096x4096) with strong text-image alignment. It achieves this through a deep compression autoencoder, linear attention in Diffusion Transformers, a decoder-only text encoder, and efficient training/sampling techniques. SANA-0.6B demonstrates competitive performance against much larger models while being significantly smaller and faster, deployable even on laptop GPUs.\n\n\n### 2.9 Repeat After Me: Transformers are Better than State Space Models at Copying\n\nThis paper theoretically and empirically demonstrates that Transformers are superior to Generalized State Space Models (GSSMs) for sequence copying tasks.  While GSSMs are efficient at inference, their fixed-size latent state fundamentally limits their ability to copy long sequences, whereas Transformers can handle exponentially long sequences. This research highlights a key gap between these architectures in tasks requiring context retrieval.\n\n\n### 2.10 Convolutions are competitive with transformers for protein sequence pretraining\n\nThis paper investigates whether Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) can be as effective as Transformers for protein sequence pretraining, aiming to overcome the quadratic scaling limitations of Transformers with sequence length. The research finds that CNNs are competitive with and sometimes superior to Transformers in downstream protein prediction tasks, especially for longer sequences, suggesting that computational efficiency can be improved without performance loss by using CNNs.\n\n\n## 3.
