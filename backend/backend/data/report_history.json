Instead of the standard tokenization, it inverts the Transformer's attention and feed-forward networks to operate on temporal points rather than variates, enabling better modeling of variate-centric dependencies and improved performance with larger lookback windows. This architecture achieves state-of-the-art results on real-world datasets, offering enhanced performance and generalization for time series forecasting.\\par\n\n\\subsection{Transformers are SSMs: Generalized Models and Efficient Algorithms Through Structured State Space Duality}\nThis paper establishes a theoretical connection between Transformers and State Space Models (SSMs) through a State Space Duality (SSD) framework, revealing their underlying structural similarities via structured semiseparable matrices. Leveraging this duality, the authors introduce Mamba-2, a new architecture with an enhanced SSM core that achieves significantly faster inference speeds while maintaining competitive performance with Transformers on language modeling tasks.\\par\n\n\\subsection{Unified Training of Universal Time Series Forecasting Transformers}\nThis paper introduces Moirai, a Masked Encoder-based Universal Time Series Forecasting Transformer designed to overcome the limitations of traditional one-model-per-dataset approaches in deep learning for time series forecasting. Moirai addresses challenges like cross-frequency learning, arbitrary variate numbers, and varying data distributions by enhancing the Transformer architecture and is trained on the extensive LOTSA dataset.  It demonstrates competitive or superior zero-shot forecasting performance compared to full-shot models.\\par\n\n\\subsection{Representation Alignment for Generation: Training Diffusion Transformers Is Easier Than You Think}\nThis paper proposes REPresentation Alignment (REPA), a novel regularization technique to improve the training efficiency and generation quality of diffusion models. REPA aligns the hidden states of noisy inputs within the diffusion network with representations from external, pre-trained visual encoders. This approach significantly speeds up training and enhances sample generation for diffusion and flow-based transformers like DiTs and SiTs.\\par\n\n\\subsection{Chain of Thought Empowers Transformers to Solve Inherently Serial Problems}\nError processing: Chain of Thought Empowers Transformers to Solve Inherently Serial Problems\\par\n\n\\subsection{BEVFormer: Learning Bird\u2019s-Eye-View Representation From LiDAR-Camera via Spatiotemporal Transformers}\nBEVFormer is a novel framework that learns unified Bird's-Eye-View (BEV) representations from LiDAR and camera data using spatiotemporal transformers. It effectively fuses multi-modal information by employing spatial cross-attention for current scene feature extraction and temporal self-attention for integrating historical BEV information, achieving state-of-the-art performance on various autonomous driving perception tasks.\\par\n\n\\subsection{SANA: Efficient High-Resolution Image Synthesis with Linear Diffusion Transformers}\nSana is a text-to-image generation framework designed for efficient high-resolution (up to 4096x4096) image synthesis. It achieves remarkable speed and quality on consumer hardware through innovations in deep compression autoencoders, linear diffusion transformers, decoder-only text encoders with in-context learning, and efficient training/sampling techniques like Flow-DPM-Solver.\\par\n\n\\subsection{Repeat After Me: Transformers are Better than State Space Models at Copying}\nThis paper theoretically and empirically demonstrates that Transformers significantly outperform Generalized State Space Models (GSSMs) on tasks requiring copying from input context. While GSSMs are efficient at inference, their fixed-size latent state fundamentally limits their ability to copy long sequences, whereas Transformers can handle exponentially long strings. This suggests a fundamental gap in performance for context-dependent tasks.\\par\n\n\\subsection{Convolutions are competitive with transformers for protein sequence pretraining}\nThis research investigates the effectiveness of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) compared to Transformers for protein sequence pretraining. The study demonstrates that CNN-based models can achieve competitive or even superior performance to Transformers across various downstream tasks while offering linear scalability with sequence length, overcoming the quadratic limitations of Transformers. This suggests that CNNs are a viable and computationally efficient alternative for protein language modeling, especially for longer sequences.\\par\n\n\\section{LITERATURE SURVEY}\nThis section

Abstract\n\nThis paper presents a structured synthesis of prior research on the topic, identifies critical research gaps, and proposes an experiment to advance understanding and improve Thermal Protection System (TPS) performance.\n\n## 2. Introduction\n\nThis section presents an overview of the research papers relevant to the topic.\n\n### 2.1 Scaling Rectified Flow Transformers for High-Resolution Image Synthesis\n\nThis paper enhances rectified flow models for high-resolution image synthesis by biasing noise sampling towards perceptually relevant scales. They introduce a novel transformer architecture for text-to-image generation that separates modalities and allows bidirectional information flow, leading to improved text comprehension and overall synthesis quality, outperforming state-of-the-art models.\n\n\n### 2.2 iTransformer: Inverted Transformers Are Effective for Time Series Forecasting\n\niTransformer proposes a novel approach to time series forecasting by repurposing the Transformer architecture. Instead of the standard tokenization, it inverts the Transformer's attention and feed-forward networks to operate on temporal points rather than variates, enabling better modeling of variate-centric dependencies and improved performance with larger lookback windows. This architecture achieves state-of-the-art results on real-world datasets, offering enhanced performance and generalization for time series forecasting.\n\n\n### 2.3 Transformers are SSMs: Generalized Models and Efficient Algorithms Through Structured State Space Duality\n\nThis paper establishes a theoretical connection between Transformers and State Space Models (SSMs) through a State Space Duality (SSD) framework, revealing their underlying structural similarities via structured semiseparable matrices. Leveraging this duality, the authors introduce Mamba-2, a new architecture with an enhanced SSM core that achieves significantly faster inference speeds while maintaining competitive performance with Transformers on language modeling tasks.\n\n\n### 2.4 Unified Training of Universal Time Series Forecasting Transformers\n\nThis paper introduces Moirai, a Masked Encoder-based Universal Time Series Forecasting Transformer designed to overcome the limitations of traditional one-model-per-dataset approaches in deep learning for time series forecasting. Moirai addresses challenges like cross-frequency learning, arbitrary variate numbers, and varying data distributions by enhancing the Transformer architecture and is trained on the extensive LOTSA dataset.  It demonstrates competitive or superior zero-shot forecasting performance compared to full-shot models.\n\n\n### 2.5 Representation Alignment for Generation: Training Diffusion Transformers Is Easier Than You Think\n\nThis paper proposes REPresentation Alignment (REPA), a novel regularization technique to improve the training efficiency and generation quality of diffusion models. REPA aligns the hidden states of noisy inputs within the diffusion network with representations from external, pre-trained visual encoders. This approach significantly speeds up training and enhances sample generation for diffusion and flow-based transformers like DiTs and SiTs.\n\n\n### 2.6 Chain of Thought Empowers Transformers to Solve Inherently Serial Problems\n\nError processing: Chain of Thought Empowers Transformers to Solve Inherently Serial Problems\n\n\n### 2.7 BEVFormer: Learning Bird\u2019s-Eye-View Representation From LiDAR-Camera via Spatiotemporal Transformers\n\nBEVFormer is a novel framework that learns unified Bird's-Eye-View (BEV) representations from LiDAR and camera data using spatiotemporal transformers. It effectively fuses multi-modal information by employing spatial cross-attention for current scene feature extraction and temporal self-attention for integrating historical BEV information, achieving state-of-the-art performance on various autonomous driving perception tasks.\n\n\n### 2.8 SANA: Efficient High-Resolution Image Synthesis with Linear Diffusion Transformers\n\nSana is a text-to-image generation framework designed for efficient high-resolution (up to 4096x4096) image synthesis. It achieves remarkable speed and quality on consumer hardware through innovations in deep compression autoencoders, linear diffusion transformers, decoder-only text encoders with in-context learning, and efficient training/sampling techniques like Flow-DPM-Solver.\n\n\n### 2.9 Repeat After Me: Transformers are Better than State Space Models at Copying\n\nThis paper theoretically and empirically demonstrates that Transformers significantly outperform Generalized State Space Models (GSSMs) on tasks requiring copying from input context. While GSSMs are efficient at inference, their fixed-size latent state fundamentally limits their ability to copy long sequences, whereas Transformers can handle exponentially long strings. This suggests a fundamental gap in performance for context-dependent tasks.\n\n\n### 2.10 Convolutions are competitive with transformers for protein sequence pretraining\n\nThis research investigates the effectiveness of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) compared to Transformers for protein sequence pretraining. The study demonstrates that CNN-based models can achieve competitive or even superior performance to Transformers across various downstream tasks while offering linear scalability with sequence length, overcoming the quadratic limitations of Transformers. This suggests that CNNs are a viable and computationally efficient alternative for protein language modeling, especially for longer sequences.\n\n\n## 3.

    "markdown": "# transformers\n\n### Research Report\n\n---\n\n## 1. Abstract\n\nThis paper presents a structured synthesis of prior research on the topic, identifies critical research gaps, and proposes an experiment to advance understanding and improve Thermal Protection System (TPS) performance.\n\n## 2. Introduction\n\nThis section presents an overview of the research papers relevant to the topic.\n\n### 2.1 Scaling Rectified Flow Transformers for High-Resolution Image Synthesis\n\nThis paper presents a novel approach to high-resolution image synthesis using rectified flow transformers. The authors introduce an improved noise sampling technique that biases training towards perceptually relevant scales and a transformer architecture with modality-specific weights and bidirectional information flow for enhanced text-to-image generation. Their largest models demonstrate state-of-the-art performance.\n\n\n### 2.2 iTransformer: Inverted Transformers Are Effective for Time Series Forecasting\n\niTransformer reconfigures the Transformer architecture for time series forecasting by inverting the dimensions, applying attention to individual time points to capture multivariate correlations, and using the feed-forward network for each variate to learn nonlinear representations. This approach achieves state-of-the-art results, demonstrating improved performance, generalization, and efficient utilization of lookback windows, positioning it as a robust backbone for forecasting.\n\n\n### 2.3 Transformers are SSMs: Generalized Models and Efficient Algorithms Through Structured State Space Duality\n\nThis paper establishes a theoretical connection between Transformers and State-Space Models (SSMs) through a \"state space duality\" (SSD) framework, which unifies these architectures via structured semiseparable matrices. This framework leads to the development of Mamba-2, a new architecture that refines Mamba's selective SSM, achieving significant speedups (2-8X) while maintaining competitive performance with Transformers on language modeling tasks.\n\n\n### 2.4 Unified Training of Universal Time Series Forecasting Transformers\n\nThis paper introduces Moirai, a Masked Encoder-based Universal Time Series Forecasting Transformer, designed to overcome challenges in universal time series forecasting like cross-frequency learning, arbitrary variates, and distributional variations. Trained on the large-scale LOTSA dataset, Moirai demonstrates competitive or superior zero-shot forecasting performance compared to full-shot models.\n\n\n### 2.5 Representation Alignment for Generation: Training Diffusion Transformers Is Easier Than You Think\n\nThis paper proposes REPresentation Alignment (REPA), a simple regularization technique to improve diffusion model training by aligning noisy hidden states with external, pre-trained visual representations. This method significantly enhances training efficiency and generation quality for diffusion and flow-based transformers like DiTs and SiTs, achieving faster training times and state-of-the-art FID scores.\n\n\n### 2.6 Chain of Thought Empowers Transformers to Solve Inherently Serial Problems\n\nError processing: Chain of Thought Empowers Transformers to Solve Inherently Serial Problems\n\n\n### 2.7 BEVFormer: Learning Bird\u2019s-Eye-View Representation From LiDAR-Camera via Spatiotemporal Transformers\n\nBEVFormer is a novel framework that learns unified Bird's-Eye-View (BEV) representations from LiDAR and camera data using spatiotemporal transformers. It leverages spatial cross-attention for multi-modality fusion and temporal self-attention for historical BEV information aggregation. This approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on 3D perception tasks and extends to object tracking, vectorized mapping, occupancy prediction, and end-to-end autonomous driving.\n\n\n### 2.8 SANA: Efficient High-Resolution Image Synthesis with Linear Diffusion Transformers\n\nSANA is a text-to-image framework designed for efficient high-resolution image synthesis (up to 4096x4096) with strong text-image alignment. It achieves this through a deep compression autoencoder, linear attention in Diffusion Transformers, a decoder-only text encoder, and efficient training/sampling techniques. SANA-0.6B demonstrates competitive performance against much larger models while being significantly smaller and faster, deployable even on laptop GPUs.\n\n\n### 2.9 Repeat After Me: Transformers are Better than State Space Models at Copying\n\nThis paper theoretically and empirically demonstrates that Transformers are superior to Generalized State Space Models (GSSMs) for sequence copying tasks.  While GSSMs are efficient at inference, their fixed-size latent state fundamentally limits their ability to copy long sequences, whereas Transformers can handle exponentially long sequences. This research highlights a key gap between these architectures in tasks requiring context retrieval.\n\n\n### 2.10 Convolutions are competitive with transformers for protein sequence pretraining\n\nThis paper investigates whether Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) can be as effective as Transformers for protein sequence pretraining, aiming to overcome the quadratic scaling limitations of Transformers with sequence length. The research finds that CNNs are competitive with and sometimes superior to Transformers in downstream protein prediction tasks, especially for longer sequences, suggesting that computational efficiency can be improved without performance loss by using CNNs.\n\n\n## 3.
