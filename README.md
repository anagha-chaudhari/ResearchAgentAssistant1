## 🌟 Overview

The **AI Research Paper Assistant** is a **multi-agent artificial intelligence system** that automates the complete academic research workflow.  
It retrieves research papers, summarizes them using LLMs, evaluates research quality, designs experiments, and finally generates **IEEE-formatted research papers** with a modern **web interface**.

This project bridges the gap between **academic research** and **AI automation**, reducing weeks of work into minutes.
